To Sir Jon Cunliffe, the cryptocurrency is a commodity, and investors need to do their homework on it. He stated:“This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.”Interestingly, last year, Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated that digital currencies put banks at risk, by impairing their ability to issue credits. Per his words, digital currencies such as bitcoin won’t replace establish currencies such as the US dollar, the Pound, or the Euro. According to him:“Almost always, these currency substitutions occur only once the existing currency has become deeply compromised. Even then, the thing people naturally reach for is an existing, trusted currency – often the US dollar – rather than some entirely new unit of account.”N...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1096-bank-of-england-says-bitcoin-is-too-small,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/9w0xg1a08g0.jpeg,Blockchain News,Fiat|BTC|Business|Market|Regulation,bank england official say bitcoin small threaten global economy,-0.3818

According to local publication Premium Times, the warning included any digital currency not issued by the country’s central bank.While speaking at an annual two-day workshop on the financial disruption caused by digital currencies, NDIC’s director of research and policy for international relations, Mohammed Umar, made it clear the country’s financial regulators aren’t exactly cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He stated:“The financial regulatory authorities are not playing catch up on the digital currency race in Nigeria. There is no country in the world that allows its citizens to use digital currencies as money not issued by the Central Bank.”The statement, by itself, is false. Earlier this year, Japan notably began accepting bitcoin as a legal payment method in the country, while countries like Iran and Bahrain have revealed they’re planning on embracing cryptocurrencies.Umar went on to list various notices and warnings issued by financial authorities, including the central bank, in Nigeria. He then stressed that these notices serve to “warn Nigerians who want to trade in bitcoins as gamblers.” Adding to that, Umar stated cryptocurrency adopters and traders won’t be insured by any of the country’s organizati...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1095-nigeria-regulator-cryptocurrency-gamblers,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/e1M6wwc0bE2.jpeg,Blockchain News,BTC|Asia|Regulation|Fiat,nigeria insurance regulator see digital currency adopter gambler warns citizen,-0.1027

This means that a whopping 17% to 23% of existing bitcoins aren’t currently in circulation.According to Fortune, the company used statistical sampling to determine lost amounts, and used five different categories. These were “mined coins,” referring to those mined in 2017 (not presumed to be lost), “transactional,” referring to those moved or spent last year, “strategic investors” referring to investors holding bitcoins for 1-2 years, “out of circulation” referring to those who’ve adopted the cryptocurrency early on and are just holding it, and “original coins” from Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallets.Some of these figures don’t really reflect lost coins as there are people controlling them, but do reflect coins that are currently out of circulation. Given that one bitcoin is currently trading at about $9,600, these lost coins amount to $36 billion for the high estimate, or $26 billion for the low estimate.On whether this means bitcoin is scarcer than most people assume, and on whether the market has priced the missing coins into the cryptocurrency’s value, a Senior Economist at Chainalysis, Kim ...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1093-4-million-bitcoin-lost,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/e00w0200000.jpeg,Blockchain News,BTC|Trading|Market|Business,study suggests nearly million bitcoin lost forever,0.0

In order to achieve this, a deposit must be made and put into a time-locked multisignature address prior to the trade. This is done to prevent hackers from doing a double spend attack where the attack reorganizes the blockchain it is receiving from before the confirmation sticks. If this is the case, the receiver who did not get the funds can alert a Komodo representative (who has access to the multisignature address) who will in turn access the deposit and transfer the attacker’s deposit to the receiver. Since the nodes are constantly checking pending swaps, once a hacker is found to be atte...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1090-komodozeroconf-atomic-swaps,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/fkAYiN0c0j3.jpeg,Blockchain News,Blockchain|Technology,komodo successfully make zeroconf atomic swap new barterdex whitepaper,0.4939

Notably, he pointed out that it isn’t too late to get into bitcoin, and that most Wall Street executives don’t get the cryptocurrency.In the interview, Falkvinge immediately pointed out that the upper ceiling for cryptocurrencies can be as high as $1 billion per bitcoin, but that bitcoin itself may not be the dominant cryptocurrency in the future. According to him, just like Facebook replaced MySpace, another cryptocurrency can replace bitcoin.When asked if bitcoin’s decentralized nature was its Achilles heel, Falkvinge pointed out it’s permission-less, meaning no one needs to ask for permission to transact in the cryptocurrency or be a part of its community. He justified naming himself Bitcoin Cash’s CEO as a way to “illustrate that we are not asking for permission – that’s just part of our community.”Bitcoin’s disruptive nature, partly, comes from the huge wealth transfer it’s current allowing, according to the Swedish Pirate Party founder. The last wealth transfer of this magnitude, according to him, was in 1850 when oil was found.

It affects various popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, and Litecoin, and has netted its creators at least 23 BTC.To protect yourself against the threat, it’s clear that paying attention is a must. To make sure your sending your money to the correct address, always check the first and last digits of the entered address to make sure it’s the correct one. To be extra safe, check a few in the middle as well.However, both CryptoShuffler’s admins and security experts know that often the normal process is to just copy and paste addresses, so special precautions need to be taken. Using popular antivirus and anti-malware systems may be good way to start, although they may not detect every malicious program on your computer.According to our research, anti-keylogging tools are the best way to escape CryptoShuffler or any other type of malware that attempts to take advantage of what you do with your clipboard.

Belfort sees ICOs blowing up in such a way, that he even stated they are “far worse” than everything he was ever doing.Belfort, who in the past reportedly agreed with Jamie Dimon when he stated bitcoin was “a fraud” revealed that his comments were aimed at scammers who are trying to use ICOs to manipulate and scam eager investors.

Now, according to a report by CNBC, a $23.9 million mansion in London is going on sale and the only accepted pay is bitcoin.The property, located near Portobello Road, in the Notting Hill district of London, can be purchased with over 4,200 bitcoins at current market prices, given that one bitcoin is currently trading at $5,703.36, according to data from Cryptocompare.Lev Loginov, co-founder of the company who bought the property back in 2013, London Wall, believes that buying and selling property using bitcoin will be the future. He told CNBC:""In 10 years from now cryptocurrencies will take over. It will be in wide use just like debit cards and credit cards.”According to Loginov, London Wall will soon start selling various properties for bitcoin. He believes that property ownership records can be transformed with the use of blockchain technology, as it allows them not to be tampered with, while being easily accessible.He admitted, however, that this was all still in an experimental stage, and that details of the sale are still being worked out. Since bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, the tax on the property will be paid to the government after the sale, but figuring out how the company will pay in bitcoin to the U.K. tax office is a challenge – fiat might have to be used.Fu...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1005-bitcoin-only-a-24-million-mansion-in-london-can-only-be-bought-with-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coremedia.png,Blockchain News,BTC|Market|Regulation|Fiat|Blockchain,bitcoin million mansion london bought bitcoin,0.0

One day later, following President Vladimir Putin’s call not to create “unnecessary barriers” for cryptocurrencies, the country’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, stated the country is going to regulate them.According to Sergei Svetsov, blocking bitcoin exchanges would help protect Russian citizens and businesses from the “unreasonably high risks” they would face if they were to deal with cryptocurrencies. Following his comments, president Putin held a meeting attended by top regulators to discuss cryptocurrencies.In the meeting, Putin recognized their current relevance, but emphasized their lack of security as, if the market is in a bubble, there’s no legally responsible entity. However, at the end of the meeting, Putin cited the number of countries working on legislative framework for cryptocurrencies, and asserted there was a need for regulations in the country to protect Russia’s citizens and businesses, stating it was important “not to create unnecessary barriers.”As stated, according to Reuters, Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov said that authorities agreed to regulate the cryptocurrency market, and hope to set out how their regulations will work by the end of the year.Siluan...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1001-russia-to-regulate-the-cryptocurrency-limiting-the-amount-individuals-can-purchase,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/c8Ug0100010.jpeg,Blockchain News,BTC|Market|Regulation|Exchange|Fiat,russia regulate cryptocurrency limiting amount individual purchase,0.0

4029,2017-10-11,10121,1507740953,MyTrackNet: The Ultimate Lost and Found,"According to an article in Psychology Today by Susan Krauss Whitbourne, Ph.D, studies show that in order for us to memorize things we must first encode them in our brains by being conscious of our actions at the moment. The problem is that most of us mindlessly go about our day's activities, often engrossed with several concerns at once. To a certain extent we all dissociate, and so the part of our brain carrying out routine activities doesn't connect with the part of our brain responsible for conscious thought. This results in us forgetting and losing things.In order to compensate for the what our brain cannot achieve, tracking and tracing technologies seem to be a good solution. In fact, tracking of pedestrians, vehicles or any kind of object have been an expanding business in the last decades and now, the concept is making its way into the cryptocurrency world.MyTrackNet intends to create a network that will help people find lost items, pets or even people! In order to achieve this, MyTrackNet wants to unite large numbers of people around the world and provide a wide geographical coverage to find said lost valuables. MyTrackNet will function as a lost &amp; found platform that will provide a feature to track any lost valuable by Bluetooth, using crowdgps technology to reconstruct and visualize the path of a moving device.Anyone is able to join regardless of the tracker device they own and even those who don’t own a bluetoot...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/1000-mytracknet-the-ultimate-lost-and-found,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/d80ag2i0900.jpeg,Blockchain News,Technology|Business,mytracknet ultimate lost found,-0.3182

A study published by Neustar Research has found that 43% of organizations affected by a DDoS attack saw an average of $250,000 revenue loss per hour.The crypto industry doesn’t escape these attacks. News websites, mining pools and even exchanges are being targeted. Kraken went down for one hour on May 8 leading to huge trader losses. During this time Poloniex has also been target of severe DDoS leaving users unable to trade and consequently outraged by the situation. The events on both exchanges have even led to the exchanges being scrutinized by law firm Berns Weiss LLP. Enter Gladius, a decentralized network that protects websites against DDoS attacks and accelerates content delivery through a novel Content Delivery Network (CDN). In order to achieve these goals, Gladius will leverage pools of users that provide their idle or unused bandwidth to help mitigate DDoS attacks and participate in a global CDN. The whitepaper reads:""Gladius’ mission is to negate the harm brought by new vulnerabilities and take advantage of the same style of decentralized network that attackers have long used.

Per Bloomberg, the CFTC is focusing on understanding what role margin trading might’ve played in the cryptocurrency’s crash, as at the time Coinbase’s GDAX allowed traders to use burrowed money to leverage their positions.Coinbase, which notably claims to have over 10.6 million users, and to have facilitated $20 billion in digital currency transactions, is currently regulated in various states through a patchwork system, but isn’t registered with the CFTC. Following June’s flash crash, it discontinued margin trading on GDAX.The CFTC’s investigation should come as no surprise. As covered by Core Media, the agency is committed to FinTech innovation and is going to pay careful attention to scammers misusing the cryptocurrency, according to the agency’s Director of Enforcement, James McDonald.Moreover, according to a report covered by Core Media, complaints against Coinbase surged by 4,700% this year.

That is the case of China, where most of mining operations are located and where roughly 60% of bitcoin mining occurs. Although recent developments might force mining pools to close or change geographically, currently four of the five biggest bitcoin mining pools are located in China. The centralization of mining poses a big threat to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, seeing as miners have the power to group together and make decisions for the whole network. However, this might not even be the biggest problem. Due to the country’s laxed environmental policies, mining in China has a detrimental impact on the environment. In an effort to reduce the harmful effects of mining on our world, a project named HydroMiner is working on providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.HydroMiner is a cryptocurrency mining company located in the Alpine region of Europe. What distinguishes them from the rest is the fact they use renewable energy, in this case hydro power, in order to power their mining facility.

Bitcoin is great, but ""if it's not private, it's not safe."" https://t.co/HqwQOvSCiz— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 28, 2017As Snowden pointed out bitcoin isn’t a completely anonymous currency, as blockchain tracing software can be used to connect a specific wallet to an individual, and even to reveal his identity. Zcash, on the other hand, uses zk-snarks to ensure user anonymity.When another Twitter user asked for Snowden’s thoughts on Monero, he revealed that he thought it was a great project, but that in “amateur crypto” mistakes are bound to happen, and these can have huge consequences for whistleblowers like him.

This year, over 1.65 million computers were infected with crypto miners, while in 2013 the number of infections was of 205,000.Recently, according to a report published by Slovakian security software firm ESET, hackers have been found to have infected hundreds of Windows serves with a cryptocurrency miner, and managed to make over $63,000 in Monero over three months.According to ESET, the infected machines were in Thailand, Germany, Taiwan, and Morocco, among other countries. These were running Windows Server 2003 and, as such, the hackers managed to exploit them using relatively unsophisticated attacks. In fact, the firm’s report points to widely available techniques, and simple modifications done to open-source software.To create a Monero mining botnet, the hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0, a type of web server software, that was discovered in March. Unpatched machines didn’t close the loophole and, as such, remain vulnerable.

Corporate efforts to reduce these dangers and to increase sustainability are far from voluntary or satisfactory. As this problem grows, the need for a radical change in the way we do business becomes evident.As awareness and legislative efforts regarding these issues grow, the potential for the Natural Capital asset class grows with them. However, there is still no transparent mechanism that can connect producers of these Natural Assets with the buyers and consumers which leads to the classical middleman problem, where the privileged few reap the benefits generated by the industry at the expense of the producers and consumers.This is an issue that can damper the growth of the Natural Capital asset economy, thus intervening with one of the most promising efforts against climate change. That’s where the ImpactChoice project comes in. Through the use of the Earth Token, a cryptocurrency-based token, and a Natural Asset Marketplace, the ImpactChoice project is able to connect producers and consumers directly, ensuring that every stakeholder in the “climate value chain” is able to participate. So, how does it work?ImpactChoice is in the process of developing the “Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform”, which will allow certified Natural Capital Asset project developers to list their products...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/965-impactchoice-how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-climate-change,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/fgMQ0wa120w.jpeg,Blockchain News,ICO|Blockchain|Exchange|Technology|Business,impactchoice blockchain technology impact climate change,0.0

After the fall, JP Morgan bought €3 million worth of Bitcoin ETNs, reportedly on behalf of its clients, which led to a bitcoin market maker – Blockswater – filing a market abuse report against the banker.Then, Jamie Dimon swung at bitcoin again, as reported by Core Media, and stated that the cryptocurrency is “worth nothing.” Notably he stated that the bigger cryptocurrencies get, the more governments are going to “close them down.”At an event held by the Wall Street Journal, according to Bloomberg, Gorman didn’t just say the cryptocurrency was more than a fad, as he also added that bitcoin’s concept is interesting, stating:""The concept of anonymous currency is a very interesting concept – interesting for the privacy protections it gives people, interesting because what it says to the central banking system about controlling that.""When asked whether he thought cryptocurrencies should be illegal, Gorman revealed that he personally never invested in the cryptocurrency, but that he’s spoken to a lot of people who have.

Nordvig also points out that the existing global cryptocurrency market is valued at over 100 billion dollars which is higher than the total value of gold held in ETF form.  He then explained that it is not surprising to see all the media hype surrounding the cryptosphere, at this attention grabbing size of accumulated assets.“The value of existing cryptocurrencies is also becoming significant, surpassing $100bn recently. That is larger than gold holdings in ETF form (just below $100bn).

The investments totaled over $600,000.Supposedly, GBI “employed a high-frequency, algorithmic trading strategy” called Jigsaw that promised to net investors profits between 7% to 9% in bitcoin. In reality, the CFTC alleges that Gelfman’s strategy was a cover-up for a Ponzi scheme, in which the money some customers invested was used to pay early investors. The CFTC wrote:""In fact, as charged in the CFTC Complaint, the strategy was fake, the purported performance reports were false, and — as in all Ponzi schemes — payouts of supposed profits to GBI Customers in actuality consisted of other customers’ misappropriated funds.”To try to prove investors their money was safe, Gelfman reportedly distributed false account statements, in which he told them they were making steady gains from bitcoin trading.

After the fall, JP Morgan bought about €3 million worth of Bitcoin ETNs, reportedly on behalf of its clients.

4888,2017-09-23,76,1506170748,Breaking: Komodo Successfully Makes Atomic Swaps Using Only Electrum Servers,"As Charlie Lee celebrates the first LTC to BTC atomic swap, the Komodo team is well ahead of the pack with their latest breaking news; successful atomics swaps using only electrum servers. The difference between the two is important to note, for one is using only local coin daemons and the other is using hosted electrum nodes.After JL777’s trade, another Komodo team member with the handle “cipi”, made his own atomic trades using the Electrum servers, further confirming its legitimately.  Atomic swap cross-chain trading refers to a trade that bypasses a medium of exchange and trades directly with another coin without the need of a centralized exchange. Atomic swaps have been well established by the Komodo team for quite some time with 100’s of atomic trades already made by the team. Now, the team is moving the technology further by creating atomic swaps using hosted nodes.These hosted nodes, named “Electrum” servers, allow users to interact with the cryptocurrency at hand without having to download and broadcast the whole blockchain. As you can imagine, for wallets that allow multiple coins to do atomic swaps, it is imperative to create a method that bypasses downloading the blockchain. Some blockchains can take days to download and may use up a lot of hard-drive space. Bitcoin’s blockchain, for example, has passed the 100GB mark. Local coin daemons refer to a local wallet with a fully downloaded blockchain.JL777, head coder of...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/953-breaking-komodo-successfully-makes-atomic-swaps-using-only-electrum-servers,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/800z20w0000.jpeg,Blockchain News,Blockchain|Exchange|BTC|LTC|Technology,breaking komodo successfully make atomic swap using electrum server,0.4939

The national currency, Bolívar, has lost so much of its value that playing video games for bitcoins is now a viable option to earn a living.Gold FarmingThe practice of gold farming is not new. It first started in the 1990’s when videogamers started to sell virtual items from massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in exchange for real money, fiat currencies at the time. It first originated in South Korea but it is now practiced all over the world, being extremely popular in China. Employing about 400,000 people, China is the biggest gold farming market with about 80% of the industry based on the country. According to reports, it seems like the gold farming trend has now spread to Venezuela. Venezuela citizens are playing Runescape, a popular MMORPG, in order to obtain (“farm”) in-game items. Those items are then sold inside the Runescape economy for in-game gold and platforms like Papusgold that exchanges gold for Bitcoins. Seeing as unemployment is at an all-time high and minimum wage is currently $12,50/month, it’s not hard to see why people turn to online gaming as a way of sustenance. Gold farming in Runescape can earn you an average of $0,50 an hour, making it a very attractive hourly rate for many people in the country.Several projects in the blockchain space are addressing the in-game items’ market by turning said items...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/952-economic-crisis-how-bitcoin-and-videogames-are-helping-citizens-venezuela,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coremedia.png,Blockchain News,Fiat|Asia|Market|BTC|Exchange,economic crisis bitcoin videogames helping citizen venezuela,-0.4404

Healthcare and real estate are good examples of pioneer industries where the value of distributed ledger and blockchain technologies have been recognized and solutions are being developed and implemented. Another industry that seems like it can greatly benefit from blockchain is the archaeological industry.KAPU is the world’s first archaeological blockchain. Inspired on the Capua coins, an ancient fiat currency that was forged to fight the Romans during the second Punic war in 218 BC, the KAPU project aims to create the first decentralized archaeological database which will serve as an unchangeable record of human history. How does it work?KAPU uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system which does not require the whole network to validate a transaction as the traditional proof-of-stake (POS) model. Instead, the DPoS model only requires a small number of delegates to validate a transaction. There will be 51 original delegates in the KAPU network which will be elected through a decentralized voting mechanism. These are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain, receiving fees for their services. In case one of the delegates goes rogue or stops performing their job, the votes may be revoked and...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/951-kapu-the-first-archaeological-blockchain,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/ez3ME086200.jpeg,Blockchain News,Blockchain|Technology|Wallet|Fiat,kapu first archaeological blockchain,0.0
