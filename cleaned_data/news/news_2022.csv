The very nature of such organizations presents a culture shock because of the revolutionary outcomes they present. Their user-focused policies which undermine intermediary setups that make revenue from user data and identity ownership control are breathtaking. Despite the existence of most DAOs in trial stages, there are a lot of success stories that provide a chance for research on their effectiveness. The points of focus in the analysis of the organizations are decentralization, autonomy, and whether they are actual organizations. Are DAOs Decentralized in Reality? The theoretical framework of a DAO is based on the decentralized nature of its operations. The construction of the organizations on a blockchain platform is evidence of decentralization in theory. The blockchain ensures that all user nodes have a direct claim of ownership of user data and digital identity over the network. The lack of central entities such as privately owned service providers is indicative of a system that embraces decentralization. However, practical decentralization is another aspect to achieve considering the interests and conditions that prevail. DAOs will reach their intended level of decentralization based on the achievement of technological development that supports Web 3.0.

Should you expect a bullish breakout to surpass the 200-day EMA? Key technical points: EOS prices have increased by 2.36% in the past 24 hours. In addition, the 50 and 100-day EMA tease a bullish crossover. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of EOS is $768 Million, marking a 60% rise.

However, the recent daily candle shows a 2.92% decline increases the fallout chances. The rising 20-and-50-day EMA accentuates a strong recovery rally.

21,2022-04-05,27505392,1649185230,How Bitcoin Will Impact Global Market if Accepted as Legal Tender in all Countries,"The discussion about the integration of Cryptocurrencies as legal tender in various countries is taking shape with more trials providing guidelines. Despite the failures occasioned by geopolitical events globally, there is a desire to trade on crypto platforms amongst the masses. The phenomenon measured on the fear-greed index scale indicates that peoples�� feelings toward crypto trading lie on the greed side. Bitcoin has been among the big gainers in recent weeks showing that consumers understand its value. The following are predictable advantages of making BTC a legal tender across the world: Decentralization will Cushion Global Market against Geopolitical Conditions The current trend of BTC trading shows it is regaining stability, proving its ability to survive harsh geopolitical conditions. However, accepting crypto as a form of legal trading will shift the dynamics by ensuring global goodwill towards its success. The current fluctuations result from reluctance to trade in BTC due to the impacts of the international events on countries�� fiat currency valuations. Creating a decentralized global finance (DeFi) ecosystem will ensure that global trade is safe from unfavorable conditions.

22,2022-04-05,27505391,1649185210,Bitcoin Monthly Outflows Reach Historically High Value,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin monthly outflows have recently reached values only seen a few times before in the crypto&#8217;s entire history. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Now Have A Value Of 96.2k BTC Per Month According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a historically high amount of BTC has exited all exchange wallets recently. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;exchange net position change,&#8221; which tells us the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering wallets of all exchanges. The metric&#8217;s value is simply calculated by taking the difference between the outflows and the inflows. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means inflows are dominating the outflows right now, and a net amount of coins is moving into exchanges. Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto as investors usually deposit their crypto to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, positive values of the metric imply there is a net amount of Bitcoin exiting exchange wallets at the moment. This kind of trend, when sustained, may prove to be bullish for the price of the coin as it can be an indication that investors are accumulating right now.

Even though the coin is in a bullish breakout pattern, losses below the middle BB would diffuse the upside momentum. Past Performance DASH is in a tight trade range as per the formation in the daily chart. The coin is in a bullish breakout formation, clearing $105 but capped at $140. It could tear higher or pull back in a retest depending on the breakout direction. DASH Technical Analysis As per the technical candlestick formation in the daily chart, the coin is in a bullish breakout formation above the descending wedge. The coin is bottoming up at spot rates, firm above the $120 support level flashing with February 2022. At spot rates, aggressive traders may load on dips above $120 and the positive inclining middle BB. However, since prices are consolidating, printing lower lows versus the upper BB, there could be precise entries above $140 or below the middle BB, depending on the breakout direction. A close above $140 may see DASH expand to Q1 2022 highs of around $155 in a bullish continuation pattern. What to Expect? DASH traders are buoyant at spot rates regardless of the consolidation.

MI records intensive selling from Binance order books, inventors have been dumping as much as $50 million in the last day which has contributed with BTC��s price downside action. To the upside, resistance seems heavy and could prevent Bitcoin from reclaiming previous highs. MI records over $40 million in asks or selling orders. The increase in selling pressure suggest the bears could take over the price action, at least, in the short term. If the bulls are able to sustain current levels, which seems unlikely due to the above, BTC��s price could squeeze late shorters and make another run into $48,000 and $50,000. However, Bitcoin has been unable to break above these ...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/dont-look-down-bitcoin-ready-to-re-test-support-zone-at-44k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|btc|btcusd,BTC|Trading|ETH|Exchange|Market,dont look bitcoin ready re-test support zone 44k,0.6369

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Broken Above 1 Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC STH-SOPR is currently forming a pattern that has historically been bullish for the coin. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (or the SOPR in short) is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us whether coins in the market are selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The metric works by looking at the history of each coin being sold and checking whether the price it last moved at was less than the current one or more than it. When the value of this indicator is above one, it means investors are, on average, selling their Bitcoin at a profit right now. Related Reading &#124;?Possible Timelines For Bitcoin To Hit $100k: Why CEOs See Bullish Signs On the other hand, SOPR values below one imply overall losses are being realized in the BTC market at the moment. A modified version of this indicator takes into account only those investors who held their coins for less than 155 days before selling them. This group of investors is called the short-term holders (STH).

Although buyers rallied 125 percent from mid-February 2022, sellers appear to be in charge at spot rates. Preceding today��s lower lows was consolidation with long upper wicks pointing to selling pressure in smaller time frames.

The need for decentralized money has pushed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to global prominence. However, blockchain has limits. These systems are, by definition, cut off from the rest of the world. There is a need for some kind of bridge to allow these systems to observe what is going on in the outside world. That is exactly the problem that Chainlink can help to solve, as we will see. What is a Smart Contract? Smart contracts are simply agreements written in code that are typically run on a blockchain. You may be wondering why a blockchain? Well, what happens on a blockchain cannot be changed, so when you and someone else come up with a financial agreement, changing that agreement would require changing millions of computers all over the world.

They can then become more complicated, such as ��if I give you ten dollars of Ethereum, you��ll give me ten dollars of doggy coins,�� where the code can actually check if both people truly have ten dollars of each token that they want to trade and then automate the trading so that if one person doesn��t give all ten dollars or changes their mind, the other person will.

In using it, there are also privacy gains. The huge innovation, though, is the cash-like experience. The Kraken integration comes with a Lightning node of their own. To implement it, the company used LND by Lightning Labs. The reason is that ��they have the largest user base and we have a lot of people on the network that have lots of experience with LND. So it has proven to be easy to use and very reliable as well.�� That��s according to Kraken��s bitcoin product manager, Pierre Rochard, who also said to Bitcoin Magazine: ��Adoption is going to come from people who have fiat in their bank account, and they need to get it into Bitcoin.

185,2022-04-02,27502776,1648906687,CLIFF Uses Deflationary Mechanism to Boost Token Price Regularly,"Dogecoin started as a joke but ended up attracting billions of US dollars and the interest of Elon Musk himself. The cryptocurrency with the Shiba Inu dog as its logo has become an inspiration for many other crypto projects. The most recent example is Cliff, although it hasn��t been designed as a purposeful parody. On the contrary, Cliff, which also has a dog as its symbol, is seeking to help investors secure sizable returns by implementing a deflationary model. What Is Cliff and How Does It Work? Cliff is the first token with a true burn function that can directly and instantly boost the price per coin as a result of burning its circulating supply. The burning mechanism makes sure that Cliff keeps eliminating the excess liquidity on a regular basis. Every time it does so, the event pushes the price of each token up by a certain percentage. Besides this, the token��s value also increases as Cliff has exposure to yield-bearing assets with the goal to provide value to token holders. Thus, Cliff is a token seeking to act as a hedge fund and grow continually thanks to two main mechanisms: burning a percentage of the circulating supply and investing in yield-bearing assets. Here is how the burn function works: Every trade on Uniswap or other DEX comes with a liquidity fee. Currently, the tax is set at 5% for buys, and 8% for sells but it��s subject to change based on the market conditions. After a certain threshold, the smart contract...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/cliff-uses-deflationary-mechanism-to-boost-token-price-regularly/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Company News,ICO|Trading|Market|Regulation|Business,cliff us deflationary mechanism boost token price regularly,0.4019

217,2022-04-01,27501816,1648839638,Ethereum Bullish Signal: 1.2 Million ETH Exited Exchanges Recently,"Ethereum on-chain data shows more than 1.2 million ETH has exited exchanges over the past two weeks, a sign that could be bullish for the price of the crypto. Ethereum Exchange Reserve Has Observed Significant Decline In The Last Couple Of Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH exchange reserve has lost over 5% in value in just the last fourteen days. The &#8220;all exchanges reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum present in wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes down, it means investors are withdrawing a net amount of coins right now. Such a trend can be bullish for the price of ETH as holders usually take their crypto off exchanges for accumulating them. On the other hand, an increase in the reserve implies investors are depositing Ethereum at the moment. Since holders usually transfer their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, this kind of trend may prove to be bearish for the crypto&#8217;s price.

Every other cryptocurrency user is eager to get benefits through this bitcoin-backed bond. Ever since El Salvador announced the launch of its own volcano bond, the cryptocurrency market has gone crazy. Infusing a billion-dollar self-governing bond into the cryptography recording system would be the first of its kind. After launching such a new-fangled and highly regarded element, is it prudent to disregard and overstep all traditional ways to conduct cryptocurrency business? Does the presence of Volcano Bond mean that existing financial institutions will no longer need to lend and support crypto exchanges? Well, that answer might not thrill the crypto enthusiasts. In order to understand this story, it is necessary to realize that El Salvador announced the concept of Volcano Bond a long time ago, and people have been waiting for its sale ever since then. However, the sale had to be postponed due to the war in Ukraine and Russia, which affected the cryptocurrency market. In recent weeks, the government has announced it is ready for sale following approval of local pension changes.

Welcome to Web 3.0, the latest iteration of internet services and the next stage in the evolution of the world wide web. This redesign of the internet is also known as the ��Semantic Web,�� and it is expected to change how people work, communicate, interact, and collaborate. In this emerging space, data will be held in decentralized networks powered by blockchain technology, thus allowing Web 3.0 to become fully trustless and permissionless.

The technology has the potential to transform the traditional financial space, including capital markets, asset management, insurance, and banking. In this short guide, we will take a look at some of the reasons that will make Web 3.0 indispensable to financial institutions, especially banks, in the near future. Web 3.0 Will Help Banks Know their Customers Better The new internet will be anchored by artificial intelligence and machine learning.

265,2022-03-31,27497479,1648753524,Why Is It Economic Bigotry to Compare Crypto Trading to Gambling?,"Despite the crypto community��s rapid rise into the mainstream, naysayers and the uneducated keep equating investing in crypto to gambling. It is high-risk and requires no expertise compared to investing in traditional assets. This comparison conveys an unfair and negative connotation laced with economic bigotry. This economic chauvinism penetrates popular media and discourages curious spectators. Historically, traditional finance has left these people behind, possibly profiting from one of this generation��s most exciting investment prospects. Higher education was formerly considered ��unnecessary�� for women, and the few existent ��women��s colleges�� inferiors. In the same vein, they sometimes vilify crypto investments, which are open to everyone. Classist Connotations: Gambling Vs. Investing It is investing when a rich person believes in a risky asset. Gambling happens when a low-income or working-class individual does the same thing. Why? This dichotomy hides classism, prejudice, and economic bigotry. Historically, there��s been a restriction on the working-class populations from traditional investment markets due to a lack of financial and educational resources. Meanwhile, the rich have exploited their access to these resources to invest and build their wealth disproportionately. Investing involves risks, but there is a general idea that only the rich can judge which risks are worthwhile.

Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Remains Low In Past Few Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, investors haven&#8217;t taken much risk since the surge in the crypto&#8217;s price a few days back as leverage in the market is low at the moment. A relevant indicator here is the &#8220;open interest,&#8221; which shows the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open on all derivatives exchanges. The &#8220;estimated leverage ratio&#8221; is a metric that&#8217;s defined as the ratio between this open interest and the total amount of coins present on all derivatives exchanges (exchange reserve). What this ratio tells us is the average amount of leverage that each Bitcoin futures investor is currently making use of. When the value of the indicator is high, it means users are taking on a lot of risk right now. Such values can result in higher price volatility. Related Reading &#124;?Glassnode&#8217;s RHODL Ratio May Suggest Bitcoin Market Is Near Capitulation On the other hand, low values of the ratio indicate investors aren&#8217;t using much leverage currently as they look to avoid risk.

Here��s Why.,"The last couple of years has witnessed the birth and growth of new blockchain-based innovations such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The latest addition to this impressive collection is likely to be Web 3.0. Web 3.0 is the newest iteration of the internet, and it is a convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and distributed ledger technology (DLT). This version of the World Wide Web will allow individual users to own and control their own data and content. In the current version of the internet, giant centralized corporations own user data and also take large chunks of earnings deriving from user-generated content. It will probably take a while before the use of Web 3.0 becomes more widespread. But starting in 2023, expect to see a more marked utilization of the ��semantic web,�� especially in social gaming networks and blockchain-enabled business models. In this short article, we will take a look at some of the areas we expect to be highly influenced by Web 3.0 in 2023. DeFi Protocols Decentralized finance is a system that makes financial products available to consumers on decentralized peer-to-peer networks. This system also removes the control and influence that traditional transactional intermediaries, such as banks, had on money and other financial products and services.

Data Shows Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Has Observed Decline Recently As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the supply of coins older than one year has significantly risen recently. To understand the RHODL ratio, you first need to have a look at the &#8220;realized cap HODL waves.&#8221; This indicator measures the USD-dominated amount of Bitcoin held by investors hodling since different periods of time. For example, the wave band for coin age more than 1+ year shows the total amount of coins all investors hodling since at least a year currently own. The &#8220;realized HODL&#8221; (or RHODL in short) ratio is a metric that tells us the ratio between the wave bands of 1-week old and 1-year old Bitcoin supplies. When the value of this indicator reaches a high, it means new holders hold a majority of the supply at the moment. Such values usually occur during price tops. Related Reading &#124;?Research Explains Bitcoin Mining Could Be Helpful For US Energy Independence On the other hand, low values of the metric suggest 1+ year old age bands currently own a larger part of the total Bitcoin supply. These values of the indicator have historically been observed near market bottoms.

362,2022-03-29,27491888,1648580426,5 Reasons Why Upcoming Cryptocurrency Startups Should be Cautious of DeFi,"The birth of the DeFi world occurred in 2017, a few months after the full launch of the Ethereum platform. Since then, DeFi has been growing at an accelerating rate, with new projects launching every month. But, starting a DeFi project requires a lot of research and development expertise. The founders need to research the DeFi space and how to launch successful projects. However, after serious research, founders should still be very careful when considering creating a crypto startup. But why should crypto startups be cautious of DeFi? Here are the five reasons. Blockchain Risks DeFi largely depends on how the host blockchain infrastructure operates. If the host blockchain has some problems, all the DeFi projects will face a similar problem. For instance, DeFi projects suffered from Ethereum��s low scale and high gas fees. Moreover, there are other compromising factors in blockchains. Blockchains using proof of stake mechanism could fall into the issue of validator cartels. A validator cartel is when multiple network validators conspire to control reward distributions in a blockchain. They end up affecting all DeFi protocols operating under the blockchain. Hence, when starting up crypto projects, founders must be careful with the choice of Dapp host blockchain. DeFi is Prone to Attacks Another reason for startups to be careful when dealing with DeFi is the attacks. The DeFi space is prone to different types of attacks that could...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/5-reasons-why-upcoming-cryptocurrency-startups-should-be-cautious-of-defi/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Cryptopedia|DeFi|Latest ICO News|Live Crypto News|News|Top Picks,Blockchain|ETH|Mining,reason upcoming cryptocurrency startup cautious defi,-0.1027

This write-up will explain wrapped cryptocurrency assets in detail to help cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiasts understand their importance and where they fit in the larger cryptocurrency industry. What are Wrapped Cryptocurrency Assets? A wrapped asset can be simply defined as a cryptocurrency token pegged to another asset. However, this definition makes wrapped assets much similar to stablecoins. For a more elaborate representation, a wrapped is a token that represents the original coin in a foreign blockchain. It is called a wrapped asset because the original crypto coin is put in a digital vault called the wrapper that allows it to exist on a non-native blockchain. The wrapped asset holds the same value as the original cryptocurrency, and apart from being used on other blockchains, some wrapped assets are redeemable for the original coin. Essentially, wrapped assets exist in two types. However, it is widely conceded that stablecoins were the first class of wrapped assets regardless of the massive differences.

Bitcoin Top 10 Exchange Inflows (Whales) Form A Peak Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC top ten exchange inflows have showed a bearish formation recently. The &#8220;all exchanges inflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin entering wallets of all exchanges during a specific period. Investors usually deposit their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes. Therefore, any spikes in the metric can be bearish for the price of the crypto. A modification of this indicator is the &#8220;top 10 exchange inflow,&#8221; which measures the sum of the ten largest transactions going to centralized exchanges. As these transfers usually belong to whales, high values of the metric may be a sign of dumping from these massive Bitcoin holders. On the other hand, low top ten inflow values may suggest that whales are selling a normal amount of coins at the moment.

454,2022-03-27,27486527,1648409441,Rollups are the Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum,"User activity on Ethereum has seen slow growth due to Ethereum��s high gas fees. Users prefer to use Solana, Avalanche, Fantom as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. Ethereum has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains. On Ethereum, only 10-12 transactions get executed per second, while on other Layer 1 blockchains have the capacity of thousands of transactions per second. High Gas fees and less throughput are the two critical reasons for the slow growth of Ethereum ecosystem usage in 2021, while at the same time Layer 1 blockchains saw a major rise both in terms of users and price. Various scaling solutions can help in boosting the growth of Ethereum��s ecosystem such as State Channels, Plasma, Sidechains, and Rollups. Rollups have shown the most potential as a scaling solution out of all of these. Rollups can solve significant problems for Ethereum users, which is high gas fees and less throughput. Rollups enable transactions at low cost and have a high throughput capacity without compromising the security as settlement of all the transactions executed on rollups happens on Ethereum. Ethereum can act as a settlement layer of the Ethereum ecosystem while rollups are used as an execution layer. What are Rollups? Rollups offload computation (and state storage) from the blockchain while keeping some data for each transaction on the blockchain. They employ various advanced compression te...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/rollups-are-the-layer-2-scaling-solution-for-ethereum/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Cryptocurrency Guide|Cryptopedia|Educational|General|Latest News on Ethereum|News|Popular|Top Picks|Arbitrum|Blockchain scalability|Ethereum|Ethereum Scalbility|Optimism|optimistic rollups|Rollups|StarkWare|zk rollups|zk sync,ETH|Blockchain|Trading|Fiat,rollups layer scaling solution ethereum,0.3182

With Web 2.0 in the 2000s and still running, we were able to create a more interactive website, apps, and another animated interface that helped in better interaction with the user for collecting data. It also gave birth to social media, animated and responsive websites, and mobile applications. With web 3.0, we enter the Metaverse, which is the digital representation of our physical world. It uses the power of XR (Extended Reality), which includes Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. Devices such as Oculus Quest and other VR headsets provide you a real-life experience while interacting with games like you are physically present in it.

Today we shall talk about two controversial cryptos that have grabbed much attention after the recent rise. Cardano saw a price hike of?2.79%,?which raised its value to?$1.01, while Polkadot rose by?0.37%, with a current valuation of $20.16. Reasons for its Growth Both Cardano and Polkadot have their reasons for their recent growth. Cardano has been experiencing this high valuation due to the changing market sentiments towards blockchain. It is also considered a greener choice than any other blockchain, thus explaining the recent hike. On the other hand, Polkadot saw tremendous growth due to its protocol flexibility. Polkadot is famous for its fast transfers and quick interaction with other blockchain networks. Many times it is also considered faster and much more efficient than Ethereum. Why Should You Consider Cardano? Most experts highly debate that Cardano for long can be called the future Ethereum. It is also referred to as the Ethereum of Japan. The reason behind it is that Cardano is more than just a simple currency that can be traded in the market. It is a blockchain on which other cryptos can also be traded. In the future, it can also be used as an alternative to Ethereum. The developer of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, designed it as a competitor to Ethereum.

Instead of putting all your money in a single cryptocurrency, you should invest in multiple cryptocurrencies at different price ranges. This way, you can lessen the risks associated with investment and maximize profits due to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices. What is a long-term cryptocurrency investment? Long-term cryptocurrency investment is investing in cryptocurrency for an extended period. This type of investment is not one you make to make huge profits, though it can be successful. This type of investment aims to capitalize on the long-term future potential in cryptocurrency prices.

It��s important to understand that cryptocurrencies typically have steadier growth patterns that do not fluctuate too much, unlike stocks with erratic growth and volatility.

517,2022-03-26,27486090,1648321214,ICO Explained: Beginner��s Guide,"If you are into investments, you might have heard about an Initial Public Offering (IPO), wherein a private corporation seeks to go public and raise capital by issuing new stocks to the public.

Well, worry not, because we��re here to tell you all about this term which almost seems like a cousin of IPO. What is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)? Initial Coin Offering is very similar to Initial Public Offering, wherein the public invests their capital in exchange for equity shares. Except, unlike in an IPO where investors exchange capital for stocks of the company, the investors receive cryptocurrency tokens for their investments. Like in an IPO, the main purpose here is to raise capital to launch a new app, coin, or service. What are the Types of Initial Coin Offerings? Typically, Initial Coin Offerings are of three types ? Static Supply and Static Price ? A specific funding goal is set by the Company and a fixed number of tokens are offered at a fixed price. Static Supply and Dynamic Price ? The Company offers a fixed number of tokens but at a dynamic price. So, the demand of the tokens decides its price per token. Dynamic Supply and Static Price ? The Company fixes the price of the token, but the demand of the token decides the total supply. How Does an ICO Work?

550,2022-03-25,27484305,1648242054,Ethereum 2.0: The Future of Ethereum,"A few digital currencies are engaging for a portion of the overall industry. Bitcoin is the preeminent cryptographic money followed by Ethereum, the world��s second-biggest digital currency. However, what makes Ethereum so exceptional that it keeps on being the second-biggest digital money by market cap? Is Ethereum better than Bitcoin? Will Ethereum outperform Bitcoin? So many questions, let��s first understand Ethereum. Ethereum: A Brief Introduction Digital currencies are consuming the entire monetary industry. Consistently, new digital currencies arise. Bitcoin is the digital currency that emerged to be the most effective on the planet. Altcoins are digital forms of money that were made after Bitcoin. Altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, NEO, and Ripple have changed the crypto-world similarly to that Bitcoin has. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain innovation with its coin, Ether. ETH fills in as a stage for different cryptographic forms of money and the execution of decentralized shrewd agreements. Vitalik Buterin first depicted Ethereum in a whitepaper in 2013. Buterin and his prime supporters raised assets for the venture through a web-based public group deal in 2014. The task group brought $18.3 million up in Bitcoin, and the cost of Ethereum in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with very nearly 60 million Ether sold. On July 30, 2015, the Ethereum Foundation officially distributed the blockchain ...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/ethereum-2-0-the-future-of-ethereum/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Crypto Coin/Token Tutorial|Cryptocurrency Guide|Educational|Ethereum 2.0|Ethereum|future|Tokenization,ETH|BTC|ICO|Blockchain|Altcoin,ethereum future ethereum,0.0

ExxonMobil, the largest oil producer in the United States, intends to expand the project into other nations as well. These include Nigeria��s Qua Iboe Terminal, Argentina��s Vaca Muerta Shale formation, as well as Alaska, Guyana, and Germany. Reportedly, each month the project consumes 18 million cubic feet of natural gas. Due to a shortage of pipelines, the extra natural gas would normally be burned or flared. New Partnership for ExxonMobil ExxonMobil also unveiled an arrangement with Crusoe Energy Systems that allows the latter to power mobile generators. These are utilized for the Bitcoin mining servers on-site with the gas derived from Bakken Shale Oil Wells.

578,2022-03-25,27486467,1648234844,Bitcoin Futures Overheat With $1.5 Billion Jump As BTC Breaks $44k,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin futures open interest has jumped up more than $1.5 billion in just a few hours as the crypto&#8217;s price breaks past $44k again. Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Adds More Than $1.5 Billion Within A Few Hours As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has shot up over the past day as the coin&#8217;s price has observed a surge. The &#8220;open interest&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric is rising, it means more futures positions are opening up on exchanges. This leads to higher leverage in the market, and can result in more volatility.

By reading cryptocurrency charts, investors can identify market trends and predict the future price movements of an asset. Cryptocurrency Chart Patterns Only a few chart patterns have stood the test of time. There is no ��proven�� chart pattern that works better than another, unlike less subjective analytical tools. Following are the chart patterns available. Price Channels Create a series of highs and lows by creating two ascending or descending parallel lines. Prices tend to bounce between these levels of support (lower) and resistance (higher). While most traders buy lower and sell higher, breakouts and breakdowns can be influential. Ascending & Descending Triangle One horizontal line connects highs or lows, and a second sloped line connects rising highs or falling lows. In a right triangle, the price tends to break out or break down from the horizontal line in the direction of the sloped line.

633,2022-03-24,27482135,1648148433,Quant Explains How Stablecoin Ratio Can Give Bitcoin Buy Or Sell Signals,"A quant has explained how the data of the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) may be used to find Bitcoin buy or sell signals. Stablecoin Supply Ratio May Be Able To Predict Bitcoin Buy And Sell Signals As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the stablecoin supply ratio may help us find BTC buy or sell signals. The &#8220;stablecoin supply ratio&#8221; (or SSR in short) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and that of all stablecoins. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is how the supply of the stablecoins compare with that of BTC. Investors usually use these fiat-tied coins when they want to escape volatile markets and hold on until the price reaches a viable reentry point. So, in a way stablecoins represent potential dry powder for Bitcoin. When the value of the SSR is high, it means the supply of BTC is much higher than stablecoins right now. This means that there is lesser potential buying power available in the market and hence could be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values of the ratio implies there is a decent amount of buying power available in the form of stablecoins at the moment. Naturally, this can be bullish for the value of BTC.

662,2022-03-23,27479609,1648067437,SAND Technical Analysis: Cryptocurrency Is Ready For Growth,"24th of November- it was on this day that the active phase of SAND growth ended and buyers gave their initiative. It was from this date that the long-term correction in the SAND market began, which corrected the growth wave from October by about 70%. During the whole period of SAND price correction, the trading volumes decreased significantly. This fact indicates the reluctance of large investors to fix profits and give up their positions. Therefore, the probability of the beginning of the formation of the SAND cryptocurrency��s new growth wave is quite high. https://www.tradingview.com/x/jFDqsmNO/ At the time of writing, the price is near the important liquidity zone of $2.7. At this critical point, buyers have been in circulation since mid-January 2022. And since the end of February 2022, the SAND market has formed a fairly narrow consolidation in the range of $2.7-$3.5. If buyers manage to keep the $2.7 mark and take control of the $3.5 mark in March, the baseline scenario for the SAND price will grow to $5.2. However, even if sellers break the $2.7 mark, the positive trend in the SAND market will continue. The fact is that the SAND price from January 2021 is moving in the global growth channel. The bottom line of the global growth channel is close to $1.7. Therefore, in the case of a deep correction of the BTC price and its return to the range of $38,000-$39,000 SAND cryptocurrency may make the final fall wave.

667,2022-03-23,27479542,1648064754,UNI Technical Analysis: The Price Growth To $18 Is Quite Possible,"The ill-health of the UNI cryptocurrency began much earlier than in other cryptocurrencies. If November 2021 was the beginning of the price fall wave, UNI began its correction in May. During this correction, investors experienced two fall waves. The first, which took place in May, was quite panic and powerful. In just one week, sellers were able to lower the price by 60%. However, in order to organize the next fall wave with the final result, 75% of sellers took almost 200 days. Nobody has seen aggressive sales on the UNI market for a long time. At the moment, the UNI price is falling at low volumes in the hope of finding a strong buyer. Starting from the end of February, buyers managed to stop the process of updating local lows and the reversal process began. The critical point, breaking which buyers will regain the initiative in the market is the mark of $11.7. In our opinion, the formation of consolidation in the range of $8-$11.7 will allow buyers to gain strength to storm the global liquidity level of $14.5. The importance of this level can be seen in the way buyers kept it from May 2021 to January 2022. However, organizing a foothold for a new growth wave in the range of $8-$11.7 breaking the $14.5 mark will be a matter of time. In this case, raising the UNI price to $18 ? at the moment will be our main target. It does not make sense to plan higher growth targets yet, as the UNI price is still in a global downturn.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Has Stagnated As Sell-Side Balances Buy-Side As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC long-term holder accumulation seems to have stopped following the October high. The &#8220;long-term holder&#8221; (or LTH in short) supply is the part of the total Bitcoin supply that hasn&#8217;t observed any movements since at least 155 days ago. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means more coins are maturing beyond the threshold. Sustained such trend can be a sign of accumulation from investors, and can prove to be bullish for the crypto&#8217;s value. On the other hand, a downtrend in the metric implies LTHs are selling their coins (thus resetting their age to zero days). Dumping from these holders is usually a bearish sign for the price of Bitcoin. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC long-term holder supply over the past few years: Looks like the value of the indicator has stagnated recently &#124; Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 12, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin long-term holder supply hasn&#8217;t shown much movement since the high in October.

It is a computer program that controls financial assets or property and executes exactly as programmed. It��s to digitally facilitate, verify or enforce negotiation or performance of an agreement.

A bear market can be caused by a variety of events, including bursting market bubbles, a poor or lagging or sluggish economy, wars, geopolitical crises, pandemics, and significant paradigm shifts in the economy, such as changing to an internet economy. Another reason can be the isolation between NFTs and DeFi space. Let��s see how NFTs can help revitalize the bearish DeFi cycle. Isolation between NFTs and the DeFi space Looking back, we can see that NFTs and DeFi protocols have worked separately in the past. However, the current bearish moves in the Defi market may be corrected by the widespread adoption of NFTs. This is because NFTs have the capacity to assign value to nearly any object.

909,2022-03-18,27469958,1647636593,How Do Crypto Wallet Work?,"You must first purchase a wallet to store your virtual currency to use a cryptocurrency. It also has a unique address, just like a bank account. Depending on the coin, it may resemble this. It appears to be a completely random sequence of characters and numbers, but there is more to it. The first thing we need to figure out is how these things are manufactured. Anyone can create a new wallet by following a precise procedure to generate a public and private key pair. In the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum, this is accomplished by using an elliptical curve digital signature method. That��s a mouthful, but the bottom line is that the process will generate a private key and a corresponding public key. These keys are mathematically related to one another. You can use the private key to generate the public key. However, you cannot convert a public key to a private key. These two keys now have a distinct function. The public key will serve as the address for your wallet, similar to your bank account number.

Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Continues To Observe Further Decline In Recent Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, 50k BTC in net outflows has exited exchange wallets over the past week. The &#8220;all exchanges reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin stored in wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the supply on exchanges is rising as investors deposit a net amount of coins. Such a trend may be bearish for the price of the coin as holders usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, the reserve&#8217;s value decreasing implies that a net amount of Bitcoin is exiting exchange wallets at the moment. This kind of trend when sustained over a period can prove to be bullish for the coin&#8217;s price as it may be a sign that investors are accumulating.

Buyers could drive the coin back to $2.1 as prices bottom up after a 65 percent dump from 2021 peaks. Past Performance of Fantom (FTM) There could be elements of strength when writing, but FTM prices are down over 65 percent from peaks. When writing, FTM is down 14 percent on the last trading week versus the USDT, but gains of March 15 appear to be changing the fortune for Fantom holders. In the previous 24 hours, the coin is up 14 percent, rising from around the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the July to October 2021 trade range. Fantom Technical Analysis The FTM price is within a bear breakout pattern following losses below $1.30 in early March 2022. The recovery from $1?a round number?and 2022 lows could signal strength in the short term. Thus far, the rejection of lower lows and FTM prices trending inside the bullish engulfing pattern of March 15 points to strength. Accordingly, aggressive traders may find entries on pullbacks within the March 15 bull bar with immediate targets at $1.3 and $2.1 in the medium term. On the reverse side, sharp losses below $1 confirm sellers from mid-January 2022. In that eventuality, FTM may dump to May 2021 highs of $0.85 in a retest. What to Expect of Fantom?

In a blog post, Coinbase revealed that users will be able to fund their wallets from the Chrome browser extension and explore web3. With this new service, the crypto company seeks to curtail the tedious process of funding a self-custody wallet, a process necessary in accessing web3 services. Security and Easier Access to DeFi and Web3 Prior to the launch of Coinbase Pay, the process of transferring crypto via the browser extension was inconvenient and not entirely safe. Users had to go to the Coinbase website, sign in, copy-paste their wallet address. Then they could manually transfer the crypto. This tedious process left too much room for user error and transactions were irreversible.

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Shows Market Sentiment Is Again Extremely Fearful This Week As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, sentiment among BTC investors has once again been that of extreme fear this week. The &#8220;fear and greed index&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment currently among Bitcoin holders. The metric uses a numeric scale that goes from one to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above fifty signal &#8220;greed&#8221; in the market, while index values below the cutoff imply holders are fearful right now. Extreme values of above 75 and below 25 indicate market sentiments of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Historically, Bitcoin tops have usually formed while investors are extremely greedy. Similarly, bottom formations have taken place during periods of extreme fear. Because of this, some investors think buying during extreme greed is the best, while extreme fear is ideal for selling.

1065,2022-03-15,27464572,1647374745,Will Ethereum Give In To Bears?,"In 2022, ethereum has been in a bearish trend. It has dropped 40% year to date, far more than the average cryptocurrency. ETH has a long history of being one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. Since its introduction in 2016, it has largely outperformed Bitcoin, resulting in a narrowing of the market capitalization gap between the two coins. However, this year has deviated significantly from the long-term tendency. A key incentive to buy Ether has been removed from the market due to the waning of the NFT craze. ETH is now mostly used by traders, and demand for the cryptocurrency is far lower than it was late last year. Ethereum Price Swings The market has seen no apparent direction in the last 24 hours, as a consolidation between $2,500 support and $2,600 resistance continues. As a result, we can expect a follow-up push to either side after ETH/USD breaks to either side. As a result, the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain continues to undergo significant changes. Santiment, an on-chain data source, revealed that the Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped to an eight-month low, which is welcome news for ETH investors. According to Santiment: Ethereum is bouncing rapidly around the $2,560 level currently.

However, they are stable on the last trading week, capped below $550?an immediate resistance level. Past Performance The Illuvium price is stable on the last trading day but is down 78 percent from H2 2021 peaks. As per the formation in the daily chart, the ILV price is bearish, and every high may offer entries for aggressive traders. Even so, ILV has strong support at $470, flashing with 2022 lows. Illuvium Technical Analysis Illuvium sellers are in command at spot rates, reflecting the general state of the crypto market for the past few months. Despite the sharp sell-off, the stabilization of ILV prices is a net positive. Therefore, based on the formation in the daily chart, traders may wait for a close above $550?in a bull trend resumption?or a dump below $475 before placing trades.

1110,2022-03-14,27463590,1647289410,"NEAR Prices Drop 6% after a Double Top, NEARUSDT Finding Support at $9.5","The Near Protocol price is bearish at spot rates, inching lower inside a descending triangle. Currently, NEARUSDT is below a double top at $12. Past Performance Near Protocol traders may be hopeful, expecting NEAR prices to rip higher and clear immediate resistance levels. However, from the daily chart, sellers are in control. The coin is down six percent in the last trading day and at breakeven versus the USDT on the previous trading week. There could be elements of strength. However, NEARUSDT prices are still capped inside a descending wedge. NEAR Technical Analysis The failure of NEAR bulls to close above the resistance trend line and the descending wedge at $12 is a pointer to weakness. The path of least resistance is southwards in the near term. Notice that prices are also recoiling from the double top marking March 2022 highs even though NEARUSDT prices are still within the March 1 and 9 bull bars. A close above $12 confirms buying pressure, setting the base for another leg up towards $14 and $20 as prices bottom up. On the flip side, more profound losses below $9.5 and the support trend line could trigger a selloff, pushing NEAR towards December 2021 lows of $6.6. What to Expect of NEAR? Despite the optimism, bulls are struggling against a wave of selling pressure. The short-term trajectory of NEAR depends on the reaction at $12 and the descending triangle.The post NEAR Prices Drop 6% after a Double Top, NEARUSDT Findin...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/near-prices-drop-6-after-a-double-top-nearusdt-finding-support-at-9-5/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Live Crypto News|News|Technical Analysis|NEAR|NEAR PRICES|NEAR Protocol|NEARUSDT,Market|Trading|Blockchain|USDT,near price drop double top nearusdt finding support,0.34

These words were clearly confirmed by the XMR cryptocurrency during the trading week of 7 March. While most cryptocurrencies are consolidating in narrow ranges, XMR has organized a price shot by 70% for the week. Sellers managed to take the situation under temporary control and kept the critical range of $180. However, after the closing of the weekly candle on 7 March, we will not see an active counterattack by sellers, as is the case after a powerful false break in the big timeframe. Instead, we see a new attempt by buyers to squeeze in and take control of the $180 mark. https://www.tradingview.com/x/BIkSIQJe/ The XMR price growth stop at around $283 clearly showed where the main resistance from sellers is. Given the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, the high probability of USDT dominance fall, and the anonymity of the XMR cryptocurrency ? the probability of re-testing the mark of $283 is the highest. However, for such a positive scenario, buyers need to take control of the $180 mark during the week of 14 March. Closing the current weekly candle below this mark will indicate the weakness of buyers and the beginning of the XMR price fall to $145 to begin with.

Last month, the MiCA framework released a draft of its proposed regulations for cryptocurrency. One specific provision of the document suggested a ban on digital assets that depend on ecologically unsustainable consensus procedures throughout the union��s 27 member states, with the restriction taking effect immediately beginning in January 2025. The draft was met with considerable resistance from the cryptocurrency industry, which led to an amendment in the proposed legislation over the weekend. Although the framework was amended and considerably modified from the original over the weekend, it still contained clauses that would restrict the trade and usage of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin throughout Europe. Why Did the EU Parliament Propose A Ban On The PoW Mechanism? Proof-of-work is the consensus process that underpins prominent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

Past pattern may hint that a bull rally could follow here. Bitcoin MPI Seems To Be Catching Some Uptrend After Months Of Inactivity As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC MPI metric&#8217;s current trend may suggest that a bull rally could occur soon, if historical pattern is anything to go by. The &#8220;Miners&#8217; Position Index&#8221; (or the MPI in short) is an indicator that&#8217;s defined as the ratio of the number of all Bitcoin miners&#8217; outflows divided by the 365-day moving average of the same. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is how the miner selling behavior is right now compared to the average over the past year. When the value of this indicator rises, it means miners are selling more BTC recently. On the other hand, the index&#8217;s value going down implies miners are turning less active as they are moving around a lower amount of coins.

Cardano blockchain uses the proof-of-stake mechanism which consumes less amount of energy when compared to the proof-of-work mechanism. To ensure the durability of all processes in the blockchain, it ensures that all suggestions for upgrades are challenged through peer-to-peer review. Its recent upgrade to Alonzo hard fork had ensured that users can develop and deploy decentralized applications (Dapps) in its blockchain, which is more than 50-100 times more efficient than other blockchains after it had the Shelley upgrade. What is Cardano (ADA)? Cardano is an open-source blockchain that was created in 2017 and named after a 16th-century Italian polymath, Gerolamo Cardano. Its native token was named after Lovelace Ada who was assumed to be the first Computer programmer in the world. It was founded by Charles Hoskinson who was a co-founder of Ethereum blockchain before establishing it. The essence of the Cardano blockchain is to ensure that decentralized applications and smart contracts can be created with ease by individuals with little skill in programming. Cardano blockchain ensures that credentials are protected, counterfeit goods are discovered and agricultural products are converted to finished products from their raw state.

Finally, buyers have shown interest in this cryptocurrency and significantly slowed down the price fall. If you look at how easily the weekly candle from 17 January tested the range of $150, now the situation has changed drastically. Sellers needed three times as much time and volumes to perform the same operation as during the week of 17 January. In addition, the body of each subsequent weekly candle, starting from 14 February, was getting smaller. As a result, sellers failed to update the local low from 17 January and the EGLD price remained in the global growth channel. The trading week on 7 March closed above the opening price. The trading week of 14 March began with an increase in EGLD price. https://www.tradingview.com/x/7d0KBJ8o/ So far, all the facts show the legitimacy of our main scenario, which we wrote about a month ago. With the $150 mark, buyers have made their way to the $400 global target. The first obstacle to the fair growth of EGLD prices is the $225 range. A false break of this range during the trading week of 7 February caused a new portion of local negatives in the form of a lower EGLD price.

The Binance blockchain allows developers and project owners to create decentralized applications (dApps) on it. Most of the dApps that are developed in the Binance blockchain are hosted as BEP20 tokens which are in their thousands. Presently, transactions in the tokens are carried out by using ether in buying the fees in the form of BNB which is one of the cheapest in the industry. Also, recent projects are hosted on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). What is Binance Coin (BNB)? Binance Coin is a cryptocurrency that was founded by Binance exchange CEO Changpeng Zhao in 2017. BNB was formerly hosted on the Ethereum blockchain during its launch before the migration to Binance Smart Chain in September 2020 after the launch. It raised $15 million through its public sale of 100 million BNB out of its total supply of 200 million at an initial coin offering price of $0.15. BNB investors used Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase the token during the launch. Binance Coin (BNB) has been community-driven following the ease to build and launch tokens on Binance Smart Chain. This has enabled it to attain an all-time high price of $690.93 on May 10th, 2021 during the bullish run of some of the top 50 cryptocurrencies. The early investors who purchased BNB during its ICO are presently having a return on investment worth over $3800 per $1.

If bulls fail to flow back, prices could retrace from the $105 resistance level. Past Performance LUNA prices are pulling back from near all-time highs posted on March 11 when the coin rallied to retest $105. Terra is under pressure at spot rates, dropping roughly three percent on the last trading day. Technically, there is also a double tops pattern in relation to peaks posted in late December 2021. Based on the LUNAUSDT candlestick arrangement, there could be hints of weakness if bulls fail to reclaim $105. LUNA Technical Analysis Terra prices appear to be cooling off after a 140% expansion from early February 2022. The bear engulfing pattern of March 11 is from the $105 reaction level, signaling possible short-term contraction from the double tops. From this suggestion, risk-off LUNA sellers may dump on pullbacks towards $105, targeting this week��s lows of around $77. Deeper retracements below the 20-day moving average could see Terra prices drop to December 2021 lows of $55. What to Expect of Terra? LUNA is the most valuable DeFi token, reflecting its critical role in the ecosystem. Therefore, if fundamentals lead, Terra��s base is solid. However, after substantial gains, the correction is expected.

1250,2022-03-11,27461755,1647032459,Is Loopring the Future Decentralized Exchange Protocol?,"Loopring (LRC) is an open-source decentralized exchange protocol that combines an off-chain order book and on-chain settlement contracts to help traders complete successful trades. It is a blockchain-agonistic protocol that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports smart contracts, such as Ethereum, NEO, QTUM, or EOS. However, it is worth noting that they are more than just an exchange app. They are a protocol that promotes interoperability among decentralized applications (DAPPs) with exchange functionality by acting as a common building block for open standards. Trades are carried out using an Ethereum smart contract system that is open to the public, free to use, and to which any DApp can connect. What Is Loopring (LRC)? Loopring (LRC) is an open-source and audited non-custodial exchange protocol. It aims to enable anyone to build decentralized exchanges on top of it by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs ensure that assets remain under the control of users at all times. Loopring��s goal is to improve order execution efficiency and DEX liquidity by centralizing order management and settling trades on the blockchain. The vast majority of cryptocurrency trading takes place on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges operated by private corporations. The three main risks of centralized exchanges are a lack of security, a lack of transparency, and a lack of liquidity.

1255,2022-03-11,27461752,1647032004,Chainlink (LINK) Flat Lines at $12?A Multi-Month Support Line,"Chainlink (LINK) is stable, weaving above $12 as LINKUSDT consolidates. A close above $14.5 may accelerate the recovery, pushing prices towards $20 in the medium term. Past Performance It has been a challenging three months for Chainlink bulls as per the LINKUSDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. At spot rates, LINK has reversed all gains posted in H2 2021, shrinking 65 percent from 2021 peaks. Although bears appear to be in control, Chainlink has been flat-lining at around $12, tethering at near 2022 lows. Chainlink Technical Analysis After deep retracements, sellers are still in control, pinning Chainlink prices at 2022 lows. The immediate support is at $12. While LINKUSDT consolidates horizontally, there must be a sharp close above the middle BB?the 20-day moving average?and $14.5, confirming gains of March 9 for possible bullish resumption. A close above $14.5 may trigger demand, lifting LINK towards $16 and later $19 as LINKUSDT bottoms up above critical liquidation levels. On the flip side, losses below $12 may see LINK plunge to new 2022 lows, continuing the intense selling pressure from mid-November 2021. What to Expect of LINK? Fundamentally, Chainlink plays a critical role in DeFi and blockchain gaming. However, after a strong performance from early 2020, the retracement in the crypto market didn��t spare Chainlink. $12 marks a vital level.

Bitcoin Netflow Shows Deep Negative Spike As 30k BTC Exits Exchanges As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange netflow showed a large negative spike earlier today. The &#8220;outflow&#8221; is a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin exiting wallets of all exchanges. Similarly, the number of coins being deposited to exchanges is the &#8220;inflow.&#8221; The difference between the inflow and the outflow is called the netflow. This indicator tells us the net amount of coins moving into or out of exchanges. When the value of this indicator is negative, it means outflows are currently overwhelming the inflows and a net amount of Bitcoin is exiting exchanges. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be bullish for the price of the crypto as it may be a sign of accumulation.

Bitcoin is the most well-known, valuable, and well-established virtual currency. For a variety of reasons, cryptocurrency is preferred over traditional currencies. They are easy to use, with low fees, no government regulations, and complete control. Cryptocurrencies are a popular and decentralized option, but they also pose a security risk.

Many crypto enthusiasts who are concerned about security have turned to cold storage to keep their coins safe.It is widely used by major cryptocurrency exchanges as well as some of the most successful companies operating in the space behind the best cryptocurrency stocks. What is cold storage in Cryptocurrencies? When cryptocurrency is not in use, it is kept in cold storage. Every cryptocurrency wallet, whether it is for Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, has a private and public key. Cold storage helps to protect your crypto assets against hacker and malware attacks.

Historically, stablecoins have provided dry powder for kicking off new Bitcoin rallies. USDC Exchange Inflow Sharply Rose To High Values Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, almost one billion USDC has flowed into exchanges recently. Past pattern suggests this may lead to uptrend for Bitcoin. The &#8220;USD Coin exchange inflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of the stablecoin entering wallets of all exchanges within a given period. When the value of this indicator moves up, it means investors are depositing a higher amount of coins at the moment. Usually, holders transfer stablecoins to exchanges for converting them into a volatile crypto, like Bitcoin. They may also withdraw the coins to fiat. Investors use stablecoins like USDC when they want to exit volatile markets and hold on until prices are favorable enough for re-entering them. This implies that high stablecoin exchange inflows may show that prices are once again good for re-entry.

Historically, investors see gold as a reliable safe-haven asset they can run to when stocks and bonds decline. It is not surprising for gold prices to have seen a 19-month high as the U.S. and UK decided to?ban Russian energy?products. It seems that now investors are not only attracted to the metal, but to gold-backed tokens as well. What Crypto Can Expect From Macro Uncertainty The macro uncertainty has only increased in 2022, starting with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, then escalating as the sanctions on Moscow have a direct effect on commodities prices. Moreover, analysts expect that a rising U.S. inflation will be reflected in the CPI numbers to be published next Thursday. Arcane Research data noted that CPI is expected to reach 7.9%, and the Federal Reserve might perform the 25 basis point rate hike that chair Jerome Powell said he is inclined to support. Bloomberg experts, however, project for &#8220;February CPI to show an increase of 8.0% year over year and top out in the vicinity of 9% in March or April,&#8221; and added that &#8220;CPI could rise above 10%&#8221; if energy prices continue to rise. The Fed has also said that they might move more aggressively later on if inflation does not come down.

The &#8220;daily trading volume&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the blockchain on any given day. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the BTC network is becoming more active as a larger amount of coins are being moved around on the chain. On the other hand, when the value of the volume decreases, it implies the network is turning less active. Such a trend may be there because investors are waiting for the crypto to reach certain price targets before they make their move. It may also just show a general lack of interest around Bitcoin at the moment.

1387,2022-03-09,27459124,1646852298,Is Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Accurate for Price Predictions?,"?Investing in volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies can be tricky since it requires traders to gauge the market 24/7. However, tools like the stock-to-flow (S2F) model can be used to make investments rationally. Just like the traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the S2F model can help anticipate the price of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Let��s understand what is the stock-to-flow (S2F) model and analyze its accuracy for crypto price prediction in this article. Stock-to-flow ratio Explained The S2F ratio provides a number that indicates the number of years crypto will take to reach the current supply (at the current production rate). In general, with the highest number, the crypto asset will be more expensive too. An institutional investor called ��Plan B�� popularized the concept of the S2F ratio. The SF ratio has a long history of being connected with the price of Bitcoin (BTC), making it a popular approach for predicting future BTC price estimates. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known rare digital object globally, and its supply is limited, just like silver and gold, with only 21 million coins in circulation. The value of Bitcoin increases because of its scarcity, and the S2F takes advantage of this fact to predict Bitcoin��s future price. Bitcoin��s core technology ensures that the number of new coins issued decreases over time, increasing scarcity. The miner who calculates the hash required to validate a blo...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/is-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-accurate-for-price-predictions/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Crypto Price Prediction|Latest News on Bitcoin|Live Crypto News|News|Technical Analysis|Bitcoin Halving|Bitcoin is Pure Supply and Demand|Bitcoin price analysis|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Stock-to-Flow Model|volatility,BTC|Trading|Market|Technology|Fiat,bitcoin stock-to-flow accurate price prediction,0.0

The two siblings are accused of operating a crypto fraud known as ��Ormeus Coin.�� The Barksdales lied about Ormeus Coin obtaining a $250 million mining operation and collecting more than $5 million in revenue each month, according to the DOJ. The currency, on the other hand, has never reached that level of value per the release. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, said in a statement that John Barksdale ran a fraud to sell Ormeus Coin to investors around the globe through a web of lies that he spread through in-person roadshows, social media and even a jumbotron in Times Square. The allegations stem from a period beginning in June 2017 and culminating in January 2018, when Ormeus Coin��s market capitalization reached approximately $52 million. According to the SEC��s release, Barksdales dishonestly obtained more than $124 million through the alleged fraudulent Ormeus Coin cryptocurrency scheme. The Barksdales face a maximum term of 20 years in prison for each count of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit crypto fraud.

How prices react at $5.85 could shape the near-term trend. Past Performance PancakeSwap (CAKE) is trading at near-record lows at the time of writing. CAKE is down 50 percent from January 2022 peaks in a bear breakout pattern. As per the CAKEUSDT formation in the daily chart, there are no signs of sellers slowing down. PancakeSwap Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is southwards at spot rates. CAKE bulls are yet to shake off determined sellers. Although there are higher highs relative to the lower BB as CAKE prices stabilize, the reaction at $5.85?this week��s lows?could determine the short to medium-term trend. On the more positive side, a reaction above $7 may draw buyers, especially if the breakout is with rising volumes. In that case, CAKE may rise to February 2022 peaks of around $8.70 in a buy trend continuation pattern. If not, sharp losses below $5.85 may see CAKE dump to $4?or worse?in continuation of the intense selling pressure traced to mid Q4 2021. What to Expect of PancakeSwap? PancakeSwap��s fundamentals are solid. They have activated the limit-order feature as it grows in sophistication. Still, despite the optimism, bears are in charge, and there must be a sharp close above immediate reaction zones for the uptrend to be valid.The post PancakeSwap (CAKE) Finds support at $5.85 After Dumping 50% appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/pancakeswap-cake-finds-support-at-5-85-after-dumping-50/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Breaking News|Live Crypto News|News|Technical Analysis|CAKE|CAKEUSDT|PancakeSwap|PancakeSwap technical analysis,Trading|Market,pancakeswap cake find support dumping,0.1027

Past Performance The Uniswap token is snapping back to trend after immense selling pressure from late last week. From the development in the daily chart, UNI is up by seven percent on the last trading day, outperforming the USDT. However, the short-term trend depends on confirmation of today��s gains and reaction at $8. Uniswap Technical Analysis There are hints of strength reading from the UNIUSDT formation in the daily chart. The bullish engulfing pattern from $8?a critical support level?could be the base for another leg up in a welcomed recovery. Notably, the spike in the NY session is with high trading volumes suggesting demand. As such, aggressive traders may load the dip above $8, targeting $10 in the medium term especially if UNI bulls push prices above the multi-week resistance trend line clear in the daily chart. What to Expect of Uniswap? Overall, sellers are still in a commanding position despite what DeFi brings on board. Based on the UNIUSDT candlestick arrangement, losses below $8 could see UNI prices tank to $7 in the near term.

1438,2022-03-08,27457851,1646766044,Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Now Reached An Equilibrium After 2 Years Of Downtrend,"On-chain data shows the percentage of Bitcoin supply on exchanges seems to have plateaued over the past few months, ending an overall downtrend that lasted about two years. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Starts Moving Sideways As Inflow And Outflows Attain Equilibrium As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of the total BTC supply on exchanges looks to have ended its decline recently and is now moving sideways. The &#8220;exchange reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin stored in wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means exchanges are observing net inflows right now. Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the coin as it represents an increase in the sell supply of the crypto. On the other hand, when the reserve&#8217;s value decreases, it implies outflows are overwhelming the inflows at the moment. This trend may turn out to be bullish for the value of Bitcoin as it may be a sign of accumulation from holders.

It is no longer necessary to hire a team of producers and audio engineers to make music. With low-cost software, anyone in their bedroom can get started. Similarly, music distribution no longer needs physical record factories and retail ties to get those records into stores; music platforms have made it possible for artists to quickly and easily release their songs. The network of intermediaries and middlemen that arose in the early days of recorded music still exists, living on the backs of artists and curators. At the same time, the mechanics of value transfer and accrual are still largely obfuscated. Audius is the most direct-to-consumer alternative to traditional digital streaming platforms, providing direct access to Artists and Fans and ownership and interest in the network they (and you) are helping to build. Audius is a digital streaming service that connects fans with artists and new music in real-time. They accomplish all of this by also being completely decentralized. Audius is owned and operated by a worldwide open-source community of artists, fans, and developers. Audius empowers musicians to share never-before-heard music and directly monetize streams.

The &#8220;BTC miner reserve&#8221; is an indicator that tells us the total amount of Bitcoin present in the wallets of all miners. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means miners are transferring a net amount of coins to their reserves. Prolonged such trend may be a sign that miners are accumulating right now. On the other hand, a downtrend in the metric suggests miners may be selling at the moment as they are moving some Bitcoin out of their wallets. This trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto.

Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has shown signs of recovery after days of ups and downs. Despite losing a ��0�� from the coin��s price in January, Tectonic Crypto (Tonic) is reaping the benefits. What Is Tectonic Crypto? With Tectonic, users can act as lenders or suppliers of liquidity using an algorithmic-based non-custodial money market protocol. Suppliers supply liquidity to earn passive income, while borrowers borrow liquidity in an over-collateralized fashion. Tectonic references Compound, a tried and tested protocol, as part of its protocol design and architecture. With it comes an attractive incentive program powered by the native token for the Tectonic protocol, $TONIC. The tectonic protocol enables cryptocurrency money market implementations securely and seamlessly, allowing users to gain multiple use cases. How Does It Function? Liquidity is provided to borrowers through deposits by users, who may borrow at variable interest rates.

1635,2022-03-04,27455389,1646420453,Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Remains High Despite Recent Drop,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin leverage ratio has continued to stay at high values despite the recent decline in the crypto&#8217;s price. Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Hasn&#8217;t Budged Much In Response To Price Plunge As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC leverage ratio has remained at high values recently, despite the price declining to $41k. The &#8220;estimated leverage ratio&#8221; is an indicator that&#8217;s calculated by dividing the open interest with the exchange reserve. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us about is how much leverage Bitcoin futures investors are using at the moment. Here, &#8220;open interest&#8221; is the measure of the total amount of futures contracts open on derivatives exchanges. And the &#8220;exchange reserve&#8221; is the total amount of coins currently present in wallets of all derivative exchanges. When the value of the Bitcoin leverage ratio goes up, it means investors have started to add more leverage to their positions. On the other hand, a decline shows futures holders are closing up their positions. This may be due to mass liquidations or because of investors opting to take less risk right now. A mass liquidation event (often called a long or short squeeze) occurs when the price of Bitcoin makes a sharp swing, leading to a cascade of liquidations in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator over the past week: Looks like the rati...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-leverage-ratio-remains-high-drop/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Leverage Ratio|bitcoin price drop|btc|btcusd,BTC|Trading|Business|Exchange|Market,bitcoin leverage ratio remains high despite recent drop,0.2057

After an impressive rally during 2021, this cryptocurrency has lost critical zones and could return to previous lows. Related Reading &#124; Cardano (ADA) Ready For Rally Towards $1.50? What Indicators Are Saying At the time of writing, ADA��s price trades at $0.87 with a 2.3% loss in the last 24 hours. In higher timeframes, Cardano records a 19.5% and 28.1% loss for the past 30 days and over the past year, respectively. ADA��s price seems to be following the general sentiment in the market as larger cryptocurrencies are trending to the downside over macro-factors and general uncertainty. The Ukrainian-Russia conflict and a potential shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) monetary conflict seem to be operating as the core causes of unrest in market participants. However, Cardano seems to be suffering more losses than other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap. In the short term, these losses could deepen beyond $0.85. Data from Material Indicators (MI) shows major resistance for the bulls at around $0.89 which could keep the price suppressed at its current levels, at least for now.

More infrastructure and innovation in America.&#8221; Was he secretly approving Intel��s plan to produce ASIC bitcoin miners? Or did he not know that those semiconductors are an integral part of those machines? Make no mistake, semiconductor chips or integrated circuits are an integral part of almost every technological device around you. And Intel is a huge company with many products and many clients. Those semiconductors Intel is planning to produce will go everywhere. However, there��s no denying that ASICs are a big part of the company��s future plans. Recently, NewsBTC quoted Intel��s CEO Pat Gelsinger saying: ��Intel is about to bring forward a blockchain chip that��s dramatically better. That is orders of magnitude better in terms of power performance. So, we��re helping solve the climate issue.�� Exaggerations aside, Pat Gelsinger was a big part of President Biden ��s State of the Union address the other day.

Investors Holding Bitcoin Since 12 Months To 18 Months Ago Transfer A Huge Amount To Exchanges As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, some long-term investors holding on to their coins since between a year to a year and a half recently sent big inflows to exchanges. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;exchange inflow,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin moving to centralized exchange wallets. When the value of this indicator shows a large spike, it means investors have just deposited a lot of coins to exchanges. Such a trend is usually bearish for the price of the crypto as holders usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, small values of the metric may show normal market behavior and that there isn&#8217;t largescale dumping going on at the moment.

It also rolls out the DAOs credit-based loan service. 1.0 BHDP Components 1.1 BHDP Design Highlights From the above picture, BHDP (BlackHole DAO Protocol) is supported by a Treasury, with smart contracts to connect VC Pool and Donation Pool. VC Pool supports multi-asset certificate investments, part of which is used to burn BHO in the liquidity pool and the rest for credit loans after the DAOs investment succeeds. 3 BHDP Ways of Deflation: It is a common way to burn directly 60% BHO of the transaction tax 50% of VC Pool is also used to burn BHO in the liquidity pool, The BHDP extreme deflation mechanism will be triggered when the extreme inflation happens: When the stock (BHO) in the market reaches a certain amount with a 0 support rate, the deflation mechanism will be triggered.

Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Volume Says Now May Be The Time To Buy As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC taker buy volume recently reached a value that has historically been a green signal for the crypto. The &#8220;taker buy volume&#8221; is an indicator that measures the long volume of Bitcoin on derivatives exchanges. The metric works by checking orders on the book to see how many takers are buyers. This volume divided by the total volume is called the taker buy ratio. When the value of this indicator rises above 0.50, it means the majority of the order takers are currently buyers on exchanges. On the other hand, the value of the ratio below this threshold implies that the Bitcoin short volume is higher at the moment.

Last time such a trend happened was back in July 2021, following which a new bull rally occurred. Lackluster Bitcoin Sell-Off Recently May Suggest Top Buyers Have Already Capitulated As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, there hasn&#8217;t been any significant loss realization recently despite world-changing events taking place this week. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the &#8220;net realized profit/loss,&#8221; which tells us whether the overall Bitcoin market is?realizing profits or losses right now. The metric works by looking at each coin on the blockchain to see what price it last moved at. If this price is less than the current price (that is, the selling price), then the coin sold at a profit. Investors harvesting a large amount of profit generally leads to a correction in the price. On the other hand, the buying price being more than the current one would imply a realization of loss. The Bitcoin market observing a significant amount of losses being realized can be a sign of widespread capitulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC net realized profit/loss over the past year: The value of the indicator seems to have been slightly negative recently &#124; Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 9, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, it looks like a net amount of loss has been realized ...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/data-bitcoin-top-buyers-capitulated-bull-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin capitulation|btc|btcusd,Trading|BTC|Business|Market|Blockchain,data show bitcoin top buyer already capitulated new bull rally,0.2023

Despite the positive news and outlook, bulls are finding it difficult to break through the important $100 barrier. Solana close to $100 Earlier today, Solana hit a daily high of $96. The asset was one of the top gainers of the day at the time, with gains of up to 6.4 percent. The announcement of a world tour by the group behind the asset&#8217;s creation has boosted the asset&#8217;s price recently. SOL/USD Daily Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Chart Solana&#8217;s price, more than most large cryptocurrencies, is dismal and sad, as it is quite close to a key price level yet unable to attain it easily. Before Solana may enter a clear and established bull market, a substantial cluster of resistance must be broken. SOL/USD trades close to $100. Source: TradingView Continued resistance above $100 at $110 (bottom of the Ichimoku Cloud, Senkou Span A), the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement at $112, and the 100 percent Fibonacci expansion at $116 are adding to the bull&#8217;s displeasure. This indicates that even if buyers can get Solana to close at $100, upside potential may be limited or perhaps reversed as a result of another set of substantial resistance levels.

The current geopolitical situation generates uncertainty for both households and markets. The question of a million dollars for bitcoin seems to be whether it can still work as a hedge against inflation or has February proven the opposite. Geopolitics And Bitcoin A report by QCP Capital points out that, historically, the has been a poor correlation between BTC and Gold prices, which puts into question if the digital asset can be treated as a hedge against inflation to help protect the value of investments and individuals&#8217; savings. Sanctions against Russia will be felt by everyone around the world. Global oil and gas prices have already surged and are expected to escalate further. Inflation increases as the economic consequences of the pandemic meet with a war. Investopedia explains that &#8220;Assets that are considered an inflation hedge could be self-fulfilling; investors flock to them, which keeps their values high even though the?intrinsic value may be much lower.&#8221; For this reason, gold has been the go-to hedge against inflation asset for years. And bitcoin has been long-described as &#8220;digital gold&#8221;, but the little correlation between them during times of risk-off means the digital asset has traded more like &#8220;a high-beta leveraged risk asset with a strong correlation to Tech and NASDAQ.&#8221; However, there are more thi...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-failed-as-inflation-hedge-what-the-current-global-situation-tells-us/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|gold|inflation,BTC|Market|Fiat|Technology|Business,bitcoin failed inflation hedge current global situation tell u,-0.5106

Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Declines To Lows Not Seen Since Sept 2018 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange reserve has observed further decline recently, reaching the lowest values in more than 3.5 years. The &#8220;all exchanges reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin present on wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means the supply on exchanges is rising as investors deposit their coins. Such a trend is usually bearish for the price of the crypto as holders usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, the reserve&#8217;s value decreasing would imply that investors have been withdrawing a net amount of Bitcoin recently. This trend can prove to be bullish for the coin as it may be an indication of accumulation behavior.

1921,2022-02-26,27450432,1645898400,All you Should Know About Cryptocurrency Arbitrage,"Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are traded on hundreds of various exchanges globally, and the price of a cryptocurrency on one exchange may differ from that on another exchange. Cryptocurrency arbitrage is a method in which traders purchase a cryptocurrency on one exchange and quickly sell that cryptocurrency for a higher price on another exchange. This is where the old Wall Street tactic of ��arbitrage�� comes into play. ��Capturing the arb�� refers to profiting from the fact that an asset is selling for a low price in one exchange but a greater price in another. Traders use crypto arbitrage to take advantage of cryptocurrency��s lower price on one exchange by buying and selling it instantly for a higher price on another exchange. Why are the Prices of Cryptocurrencies on Crypto Exchanges so Different? Centralized Exchanges The first thing to understand is that cryptocurrency pricing on centralized exchanges is determined by the order book��s most recent bid-ask matched order. So, the most recent price at which a trader buys or sells a digital asset on an exchange is termed the exchange��s real-time price. For example, if the most recently matched market order on an exchange is to buy bitcoin for $40,000, this price becomes the platform��s newest bitcoin price. The next matching order will determine the cryptocurrency price after that. Therefore, price discovery on exchanges is a constant process of deciding a cryptocur...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/all-you-should-know-about-cryptocurrency-arbitrage/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Crypto Educational news|Cryptocurrency Guide|Cryptopedia|Educational|Popular|Arbitrage|centralized exchanges|Cryptocurrencies|decentralized exchnages|Exchanges|Trading,Trading|Exchange|BTC|Market|ETH,know cryptocurrency arbitrage,0.0

These traits make every Meta Pharaoh on the blockchain unique. To mint a Meta Pharaoh, you��ll need to have ETH. If you don��t, you can purchase ETH from any crypto exchange.

Meta Pharaohs utility Owning one Meta Pharaoh will give you access to the project��s holder-only Discord server, but holding two or more of the tokens will make you a shareholder in the DAO Wallet.

1983,2022-02-25,27449790,1645814730,NFT Vs. DeFi: NFT Activity On Ethereum Rises While Bitcoin Demand On DeFi Falls,"NFT activity is an important element in the Ethereum blockchain, accounting for most network transfers. Demand for Bitcoin in the Ethereum ecosystem has decreased dramatically since the beginning of the year. The surge in demand for NFTs and DeFi applications is helping Ethereum supporters to muffle the noise of Bitcoin maximalists who have long insisted that only the original cryptocurrency mattered most. Since the creation of the Ethereum blockchain, the case for Ether eclipsing Bitcoin has been a recurring subject in crypto. Bitcoin maximalists claim that it is still the ultimate type of digital money, stressing that the first cryptocurrency has a valuation of about $810 billion, which is more than twice Ether��s $310 billion. NFT Activity Vs DeFi&#8217;s The crypto market is diverse. Under the domain of blockchain technology are two popular applications: NFT and DeFi. Both applications provide huge opportunities in the crypto market. NFTs offer a value proposition while DeFi delivers a platform for financial services and transactions. The engagement in both has risen sharply. The primary distinction between NFT and DeFi is that NFT refers to individual digital assets, whereas DeFi refers to the internet-based financial system. NFT holds a unit of data that is unique and non-interchangeable, whereas DeFi runs on smart contracts on blockchain on its platform and eliminates intermediaries.

Major platforms began integrating with digital assets in the form of NFTs and crypto payments. Twitter, formerly led by Bitcoin bull Jack Dorsey, appears ahead of a race that for many started years ago. Big tech is just catching up. Twitter recently allowed its users to use their NFTs as profile pic with a new feature part of their Twitter Blue initiative. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other social media platforms could soon follow in the footsteps of Twitter and integrate NFTs into their platforms. The sector has seen unprecedented growth with 2022 aligned to be yet another year of adoption of high demand for these digital assets. A report from Reuters records that NFT sales scored an impressive total of $25 billion last year alone which represents a 26,000% increase compared to 2020. The sector has been attracting attention from retail and institutional investors due to its potential to completely transform multiple industries, such as entertainment, sports, gaming, clothing and fashion, and others. NFTs could disrupt industries with billions of dollars in value. In 2022, the sector is expected to reach $80 billion in total sales driven by the growing interest, demand, and inherent scarcity. Its implementation on social media platforms with billions of monthly active users will only contribute to these digital assets�� upward trajectory.

1994,2022-02-25,27449743,1645812012,ALPHA Technical Analysis: What Are The Chances Of Growth To $0.7,"During the last three trading weeks in the ALPHA market, sellers were able to lower the price to the main critical zone of $0.3. The last time the ALPHA price was in this range was in June 2021. At this time, the correction in the ALPHA market was much more aggressive in the dynamics of the fall. In addition, starting in May 2021, trading volumes during the fall wave were high enough to scare ALPHA investors. If you compare the current wave of falls from September 2021, you can see a radically different tactic. For the first time, trading volumes throughout the fall wave are lower than ever. The ALPHA price has been falling for almost six months. In the last 3 weeks alone, the trading volumes have doubled, which signals the interest of buyers in the range of $0.3. https://www.tradingview.com/x/YDpYuRlJ/ In the weekly timeframe we see a clear narrow channel of the ALPHA price fall. Sellers managed to update the local low from June 2021, but this did not add to the price of the fall dynamics. Therefore, in the case of keeping Bitcoin in the range of $34,000-$36,000, we expect the beginning of a sharp fall wave with the main target of $0.7. Though, this growth impulse should not be considered a global medium-term wave of growth. If the ALPHA price stops at $0.7, there is a high probability of a new growth wave with the final target of $0.2.

Below are the predictions for 2022 addressing potential trends and forecasts that may materialize soon. Addressing Limitations of a Seamless Infrastructure Even if competition among infrastructure providers is expected to heat up dramatically in 2021, critical challenges must still be addressed. Ethereum (ETH), for instance, is still the most popular blockchain for DApp (decentralized applications) creation, although it suffers from network congestion and expensive transaction costs. These issues are addressed by Layer-2 solutions, however, gaining long-term traction remains difficult. The same applied to ��Ethereum competitors,�� since they are still in their beginner phase. Addressing such limitations this year and beyond is required. Many individuals anticipate that the release of Ethereum 2.0 will assist to relieve some of these issues. Its sharding implementation will help solve issues such as network congestion, transaction fees, and low performance. These implementations may take time as they will occur in multiple stages. Other networks, such as Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Avalanche, will continue to draw users and developers while Ethereum remains a bottleneck.

Less Than 70% Of Bitcoin Entities Are Now In Profit As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of BTC entities in profit has severely dropped recently as the value now oscillates between 76% and 65%. The &#8220;percent of entities in profit&#8221; is an indicator that measures the percentage of Bitcoin investors that are currently in profit. The metric works by looking at each coin on the chain and checking its history to see the price it last moved at. If this price is less than the current one, then the coin has accumulated some profit. On the other hand, it being bought at a higher price would imply that it&#8217;s in loss at the moment. An &#8220;entity&#8221; here refers to a collection of addresses that are controlled by the same investor(s). So based on whether the coins held by these entities are in profit or loss, it&#8217;s possible to talk about the profit status of the entity as a whole.

Along with this demand, however, is its soaring price. The total number of transactions on Cardano has increased at around 500%, skyrocketing from 5.5 million in March last year to around 32 million this month, according to Google��s Cardano Blockchain Insights. ADA, Cardano��s internal cryptocurrency, currently has a total market cap of $29.245 billion. It is listed on the No. 7 spot in CoinMarketCap&#8217;s rankings of the leading cryptocurrencies. ADA is currently trading at $0.871949, according to Coingecko&#8217;s chart. Cardano TVL up 25% The digital token��s price also rose by 30% within the past week and over 20% in the last month. DeFi Llama data show that Cardano now has around $3 million worth of digital assets locked in its TVL which is a 25% growth within the last 24 hours alone.

Take advantage of lower transfer fees on non-scalable blockchains. Here��s an example of how a bridge is used to transfer cross-chain assets: When a user wants to convert an ERC20 A token on Ethereum to a BEP20 A token on the BSC chain via AnySwap, the ERC20 A is locked on the source chain, and the bridge is notified to generate the BEP20 A on the BSC chain before transferring it to the user. Issues addressed by Cross-Chain Bridges Cross-chain bridges foster growth across chains (as evidenced by Fantom and Avalanche prices, which rose more than 12 percent and 18 percent in the first week of November) by providing multiple asset interoperability and increased security. Investors have to go through a lot of trouble if there isn��t a bridge. Cross-chain bridges also address the following issues: Reduced gas expenses and faster transaction speeds. User assets can freely interact, providing a good user experience. Existing crypto assets�� productivity and utility have increased. Better security and privacy. In the following circumstances, cross-ch...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/overview-of-cross-chain-bridges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Cryptocurrency Guide|Cryptopedia|Dapps|General|Popular|Top Picks|Cross Chain Bridges|Hop Protocol|Multichain|Ren VM|Synapse|Wormhole,ICO|ETH|Market|Business,overview cross-chain bridge,0.0

2267,2022-02-19,27444656,1645293632,Onboarding Towards Crypto Mass Adoption,"NFTs are adding complexity and diversity to the blockchain ecosystem, and this new wave of utility is attracting a much wider audience. The blockchain-cryptocurrency sector is a little more than a decade old and still fighting an uphill battle for widespread acceptance. Those who have closely followed the industry��s rise know its potential to solve the biggest problems plaguing legacy financial systems, but before crypto can go truly mainstream, it must first reckon with some of its own inherent shortcomings. For starters, crypto-based transactions are considerably slower than conventional payments, with the exception of some cross-border use cases. Faster transactions are possible, but not without a hefty price tag out of reach for many users. This sluggish speed often means long waits for transactions to settle, resulting in network congestion. As we witnessed with CryptoKitties in 2017, scalability is a serious concern for existing blockchains and protocols running on them. Beyond these technical limitations, myths and misunderstandings abound in the blockchain-cryptocurrency domain, which presents significant obstacles to onboarding. Those skeptical about cryptocurrencies often perceive it as ��magic internet money�� with little or no value in the real world, or worse, a means for criminals to transact shady business outside of the watchful eye of financial regulators.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Shows Some Spikes Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CrypoQuant post, some BTC long-term holders seem to have participated in profit taking over the past day. The relevant indicator here is the spent output profit ratio (or the SOPR in brief), which tells us about the profit ratio of the whole Bitcoin market. The metric works by checking the past history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it was moved at before. If this previous price was less than the current one, then the coin moved at a profit. Similarly, if the current price is higher, then the investor sold this coin at a loss. When the value of the SOPR is above one, it means investors are, on average, selling at a profit right now. Related Reading &#124;?Bitcoin Sentiment Reaches Local High, But Can��t Shake Recent Fear On the other hand, when the indicator&#8217;s value is less than one, it implies investors are selling at a loss overall at the moment. SOPR value exactly equal to one naturally means the market is just breaking even right now. A version of this Bitcoin indicator takes into account only those coins that hadn&#8217;t moved for at least 155 days before being sold. This supply belongs to the long-term holders, and the metric is called LTH SOPR.

Though with models running with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, this electricity use seems to be minimal since their process for transaction validations is staking. But the story is not the same for those running with Proof-of-Work (PoW) such as Bitcoin. Mining is the associated process through which the PoW models could validate their network transactions. However, the process consumes lots of electricity as it uses highly computational equipment to solve cryptographic puzzles. This high energy consumption led to several crackdowns on crypto mining in different countries, especially Bitcoin, in 2021. The move was in line with the argument that such practices facilitate environmental pollution. This concern on energy consumption propelled the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) to research the rate of electricity consumption by some blockchains.

Ethereum struggled to maintain its value around the $3,000 mark while other cryptocurrencies dropped even further, including Cardano, Solana, BNB, and many more. Bitcoin is trading below the 50-day moving average for the first time in five weeks, after briefly reaching a high near $4600 last week. However, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has fallen back down to earth with a drop of over $4,000 in a week. Related Reading &#124; How Fears Of A Possible Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Is Impacting Bitcoin Yesterday, the price of bitcoin jumped past $44,000. It even neared $45,000 last night before being stopped in its tracks again by the level&#8217;s challenge. The cryptocurrency market has seen some fluctuation recently, with Bitcoin standing just over $44,000 and a few drops to $43,000. However, despite this drop in value, it&#8217;s still worth more than 800 billion dollars. This price dip seems misguided with the recent news that legacy financial companies are adopting cryptocurrencies. There has been so much growth in adoption just last week when it was announced by none other than New York Stock Exchange, which wants its own crypto brokerage at some point soon.

Ethereum Exchange Reserve Rises As Netflows Become Positive As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, exchanges have observed net ETH inflows recently, swelling up their reserves. The &#8220;all exchanges netflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the net amount of Ethereum moving into or out of wallets of all exchanges. The metric&#8217;s value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means exchanges are getting more inflows right now than outflows. Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the coin as investors usually deposit their ETH to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, negative netflow values imply that outflows are currently overwhelming the inflows. Sustained such values can be bullish for Ethereum as it may be a sign of accumulation.

2436,2022-02-16,27441717,1645037167,Portal Removes The Need For Wrapped Tokens And External Custodians For Cross-Chain Asset Transfers,"Cross-chain bridges can unlock tremendous potential in the crypto world. But, unfortunately, this technology has certain issues and the wrapped tokens they use. Portal wants to change that narrative by removing the need for wrapped assets or third-party custody of user assets. Cross-Chain Bridges Are A Security Risk Those are the findings of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, uttered last month. There is a good reason why Buterin uses harsh language, as cross-chain bridges are prone to 51% attacks. When such an attack occurs, hackers and other culprits control the system and can defraud users. Although a 51% attack is not a permanent problem, attackers&#8217; possibility to steal funds needs to be nipped in the bud. These bridges wrap and lock funds on other chains to facilitate transfers in their current form. It is an elegant solution, although one that introduces unnecessary security concerns. More specifically, the wrapping and locking aspect isn&#8217;t decentralized or trustless. Additionally, that approach can lead to security incidents, such as the ones affecting MultiChain, THORChain, pNetwork, Poly Network, and others. Staghead Crypto Head Neil Player adds: ��Cross chain bridges present a unique set of security risks and these types of exploits are not a surprise. It is a reminder how bleeding edge a lot of the applications that run on top of blockchains are. Exploits such as what occurred on Wormhole are expected t...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/portal-removes-the-need-for-wrapped-tokens-and-external-custodians-for-cross-chain-asset-transfers/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Company News,ETH|ICO|Technology,portal remove need wrapped token external custodian cross-chain asset transfer,0.3612

2480,2022-02-15,27441026,1644951630,Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Sinks As Market De-Risks Amid Uncertainties,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin leverage ratio has gone down recently as market de-risks amid macro uncertainties. Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Sharply Falls Down Over The Past Week According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC futures open interest leverage ratio has decreased in the last week as investors de-risk their holdings. The &#8220;futures open interest leverage ratio&#8221; is an indicator that&#8217;s defined as the ratio between the market open contract value and the total market cap of Bitcoin. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is the degree of leverage that an average user is currently making use of in the BTC market. When the value of the ratio increases, it means users are increasing their leverage as they take on more risk. High values of the indicator may imply that the Bitcoin market is overleveraged at the moment. And thus, it may be more prone to a liquidation squeeze event. On the other hand, low values of the metric mean investors are keeping their positions at low risk right now. The market is generally more stable during these periods as probability of deleveraging events decreases.

That��s not the only incentive, though: there will also be a grand prize up for grabs, with Swash adding $20 to the growing prize pool for every person that participates, until it reaches a maximum cap of $300K. Should that cap be reached, Swash has pledged to donate $100K to a charity as part of its Data for Good program.

A portion of these orders was removed and added higher, per data provided by Material Indicators. Unless bulls continue to display strength or these ask orders are removed/fill, as seen in the chart below, BTC��s price could see a local resistance and a potential short-term pullback. If momentum maintains its current course, Bitcoin could quickly approach the $50,000 mark as there seems to be little resistance above $45,600. In this scenario, bulls could score more gains, but flipping the next area of resistance into support will be decisive.

2533,2022-02-14,27440232,1644865240,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes Up,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has spiked up recently, a signal that shows dumping may be going on in the market. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Surges Up As Price Declines As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange whale ratio has risen to very high values recently. The &#8220;exchange whale ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 transactions to exchanges and the total amount of Bitcoin moving into exchanges. In simpler terms, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows the ten largest transactions make up for. Usually, these large transactions belong to the whales. So if the value of the indicator becomes high, we can tell that whales are sending large amounts to exchanges as they now make up for a bigger part of the total inflows. Such a trend can prove to be bearish for the price of Bitcoin as it may show that whale dumping is going on currently.

In a tweet made minutes before the time of writing this article, the Bitcoin critic criticized mainstream media houses like CNBC for ignoring the 2% drop in Bitcoin��s price in the face of a crisis, when gold was up by 2% to $1863, which is its highest price in the last three months. He also said that had the situation been reversed, CNBC would be constantly talking about it. Many Other Than Peter Schiff Predict a Fall in Bitcoin Prices Over the Weekend Incidentally, Peter Schiff is not the only one speculating a drop in Bitcoin��s price. With the U.S. urging its citizens to leave Ukraine amid the threat of a war with Russia, many have been left wondering if this will lead to a fall in Bitcoin��s price. Schiff, in one of his tweets made a few days ago, had said that gold was a potential alternative to Bitcoin and it was a safe investment. The situation between the U.S and Russia has been deteriorating rapidly as there have been speculations about Russia planning to invade Ukraine over its growing inclination towards the European world. Experts predict that if there is indeed a war between these two giants, it would take a massive toll on Bitcoin��s prices. If that happens, the bull run for Bitcoin would be short-lived after it managed to crawl its way back to $45,000 after falling to $33,000 last month.

The value of stolen Bitcoins from the 2016 Bitfinex hack was $71 million. This would amount to $4.5 billion today. However, the DOJ has seized only 94,000 of the 120,000 stolen BTC, which means the seizure was worth $3.6 billion. Therefore, if the DOJ were to indeed take ��advice�� from Charles Hoskinson regarding the 2016 Bitfinex Hack, they would stand to gain nearly $2.9 billion. U.S. DOJ Carries Out the ��Largest Crypto Seizure�� In a press release issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday, it was revealed that the U.S. Federal officials had seized bitcoin worth $3.6 billion linked to the 2016 Bitfinmex hack. Agents had arrested two individuals in New York on Tuesday on charges of conspiring to launder proceeds from the Bitfinex hack in 2016. The alleged conspirators are Ilya Dutch Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, who are apparently married to each other. The DOJ has called the seizure the ��largest crypto seizure to date��. Soon after the seizure was made, Bitfinex had issued a statement saying that it would work with the DOJ to try and recover the seized bitcoin.

Peter Schiff Says Gold Must Rise More Than 10% to Distract Bitcoin Investors Peter Schiff said that although gold had been doing reasonably well, it needed to rise more than 10% to return to its November highs. This was because investors were solely focused on the bearish market rally in Bitcoin. Thus, they failed to see any considerable growth in gold prices and the asset needed to perform outstandingly well to attract their attention. The traditional asset was trading at over $1,860 in November last year. Incidentally, this isn��t the first time Peter Schiff has derided Bitcoin and its investors.

All values below fifty fall into the &#8220;fear category,&#8221; while those above belong to &#8220;greed.&#8221; When the index shows extreme values of above 75 and below 25, the market sentiment is that of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively.

Bitcoin maximalists believe that in the future, the Bitcoin network will supply investors with everything they want in a digital currency. In this approach, maximalists are unabashedly in favor of a Bitcoin monopoly at some point in the future. The maximalists are a vociferous group of Bitcoin supporters who believe that Bitcoin should be prioritized over all other digital currencies. And that is not going well for a long period. Shutting down everything just to support one ideology is also shutting down improvements of any kind in the future. While many have taken advantage of Bitcoin��s success rather than creating their own distinct brand and offering value, emulation is occasionally done in the hopes of perpetuating a concept or movement rather than with the malicious purpose of stealing credit (and market share) from the original.

Agents arrested two individuals in New York on Tuesday on charges of conspiring to launder proceeds from the Bitfinex hack in 2016. The married couple, Ilya ��Dutch�� Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan will appear in court at 3:00 p.m. ET in New York. The DoJ has called it the ��largest crypto seizure to date��. 2016 Bitfinex Hack Saw 120,000 BTC Being Stolen The ��largest crypto seizure to date�� has come six years after 120,000 BTC were stolen in a Bitfinex hack in 2016. The stolen Bitcoins were worth $60 million back then and represented almost one-sixth of the total trading volume at the time. This would be worth almost $4.5 billion today.

However, they don��t claim that the two were the masterminds behind the original hack. The couple allegedly used various techniques to launder the stolen bitcoin, including splitting transactions up into thousands of smaller transactions to avoid traceability, using darknet markets, and converting the stolen bitcoins into other types of crypto such as Monero.

Recently, rallies have been few and far between, cutting the price per coin down to around $33,000 at the local low. The plummet, however, fell short of tagging a &#8220;parabolic&#8221; indicator and it could mean that the local bottom is in. Here is more about the Parabolic SAR, the potential signal, and other supporting evidence that the bottom might already be in. Parabolic Uptrend Intact, Says Indicator With 95% Confidence Rate Bitcoin price has repeatedly gone parabolic to conclude any major cycle peaks before entering a bear market. While the recent sentiment and price action across crypto has been deceptively bearish, there are plenty of signs that Bitcoin is still in a bull market. One of those signs not only suggests the uptrend is still in tact, but that the local bottom of the recent downtrend could very well be put in. That signal is the Parabolic SAR on monthly timeframes. The higher the timeframe, the more dominant the signal, and there are few as important intervals at the monthly.

Similarly, the &#8220;taker sell volume&#8221; measures the amount of sell orders. The &#8220;taker buy ratio&#8221; (or its sell counterpart) is defined as the ratio between the buy volume and the total volume on perpetual swaps. When the value of the taker buy ratio goes up, it means the buyers are currently willing to buy coins at a higher price. Such a trend shows that the buying pressure is currently stronger than the selling pressure. On the other hand, taker sell ratio moving up would indicate a shift towards a more bearish sentiment in the market. Related Reading &#124;?Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Here&#8217;s What SOPR Data Says Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these indicators over the past couple of years: The taker buy ratio seems to have crossed the 0.52 mark recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the important periods of trend.

Users of the network, especially small-time investors, have drawn the short end of the stick with these issues as they are the most affected. With fees skyrocketing, carrying out small transactions on the leading smart contracts network is becoming less and less feasible with each passing day. The high fees and congestion have sparked discussions on how it can be eliminated. There are various developments in the pipeline, like the Consensus Layer (formerly known as ETH 2.0) and other suggestions made by developers. This time around, it is atheneum��s founder Vitalik Buterin, proposing a way to deal with the network congestion, and by extension, the high fees, on the network. Blob-Carrying Transactions On Ethereum In a conversation that was posted to popular social media platform Twitter, Vitalik Buterin and developer Tim Beiko put forward proposals that would help address the issue of high network congestion. With the adoption of the network growing at a rate not even anticipated by the creators themselves, it has now become a race to find the best way to properly scale the network.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Starts Turning Green Again As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current BTC SOPR pattern may look similar to that around the bottom formation back in July of last year. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (or SOPR in short) is an on-chain indicator that tells us whether investors are currently selling at a profit or at a loss. The metric works by checking the history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it was last moved at. If the Bitcoin price before was less than the current one, then the coin is considered to have been sold in profit. When the SOPR has values greater than 1, it means holders have been selling at a profit on average. On the other hand, values of the indicator below the threshold imply investors sold at a loss overall during this period.

There exist various misunderstandings between game developers and crypto enthusiasts when it comes to NFTs. They communicate in two different languages: crypto enthusiasts often talk of revolutionary technology and social change, while game makers usually just want to have fun. This article might help you bridge that gap. Today, we will learn how everyone can work together to bring innovation and entertainment both for the targeted audience. What is NFT? The current NFT business is mostly driven by digital collectibles. Consider the non-fungible token to be a certificate, contract, or voucher that proves you own or have the rights to something specific, such as a work of art, a collectible, or perhaps admission to a concert or conference. The fact that the token is ��non-fungible�� simply means that it is separate from other forms of proof-of-ownership. It cannot be quickly exchanged for something else, unlike old money or digital tokens. When a collector purchases an NFT, he or she is essentially buying two things: A?digital collectible: such as a piece of digital art, a photo, trading card, sports highlight video clip, a piece of music, etc. It could be something incredibly unusual.

The report noted that &#8220;Representing advancing technology, Bitcoin is gaining traction as a benchmark global digital asset, while oil is being replaced by decarbonization and electrification.&#8221; Lack of supply elasticity is an attribute shared by Bitcoin and Ethereum that &#8220;sets them apart from commodities&#8221;.

In the weekly timeframe, we see that this level was initially a problem for buyers in the period from July 2019 to February 2021. It was the breakdown of this mark that provoked a new wave of QTUM price growth by $570. Now the $5.2 mark is the main base of buyers�� support, which sellers are trying to take control of for the second time. If during the first attempt in May 2021 we saw an aggressive rebound of the price from the $5.2 mark and increased trading volumes, now the situation is radically different. It is worth starting with the fact that the whole fall wave from November 2021 was accompanied by low volumes.

Yesterday, Bitcoin managed to crawl its way back into the $40,000 club after an interval of almost two weeks. This might have given Bitcoin investors some ray of hope. Also, potential buyers who have been wanting to purchase the golden crypto might have been considering investing in Bitcoin.

Current Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Is At High Values As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current BTC leverage ratio has high values, and if past pattern is anything to go by, a correction may be coming to the price soon. The &#8220;estimated leverage ratio&#8221; is an indictor that&#8217;s defined as the value of the Bitcoin open interest divided by the reserve of all exchanges. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is the amount of leverage that an average user is making use of at the moment. When the value of this indicator rises, it means investors are taking on more risk as they are increasing the leverage on their positions. During such a trend, the volatility in the price of BTC may also go up. At sufficiently high values of the ratio, the market may be considered overleveraged, and a liquidation squeeze could follow to wipe out the excess leverage.

3023,2022-02-03,27433254,1643920245,"What A Decline Under $35,511 Would Mean For The Price Of bitcoin","Bitcoin has lost its footing at $37,000 and has now slipped into the $36,000 territory, sending the market into another frenzy of fear. It comes on the back of widespread speculations that the digital asset had indeed hit its bottom. But with the current trend, the digital asset may end up sliding down further. To this end, Fundstrat analyst Mark Newton has laid out the possibilities for bitcoin if it declines further than $35,511. What Happens Below $35,511 Technical analyst Mark Newton has put forward a bullish outlook for bitcoin if it falls below this point. He told Bloomberg that a decline under this would inevitability lead to a test of $32,950. Also adding that the price of the digital asset moving above $40,000 would be an important point for the bulls. Related Reading &#124;?Double Threat: Bitcoin And Ethereum, Start Of Bear Market Or Bullish Consolidation? However, the market has seen massive sell-offs close to this price point in recent times that Newton��s predicted point for the bulls is yet to be hit. With the digital asset suffering so many price dips in such a short period of time, bitcoin looks more likely to fall below $35,511 than it is to give bulls a much-needed pull above the $40,000 point.

Percentage of Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Sinks To Multi-Year Low As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of the BTC supply on exchanges has now declined to a multi-year low of around 13.27%. The &#8220;percentage of supply on exchanges&#8221; is an indicator that measures the percent of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that&#8217;s currently stored in exchange wallets. When the value of this indictor goes up, it means the amount of coins held by exchanges is going up. This trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto as investors usually deposit their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, when the metric moves down, it implies holders are withdrawing their coins from exchanges, thus reducing their reserve. Such a trend may be bullish for Bitcoin as the supply on exchanges is usually considered the selling supply, and it going down would mean there is lesser sell pressure in the market.

3162,2022-01-31,27431331,1643661011,The Uber Rich Investors Are Picking This Altcoin Over Bitcoin,"For many years and likely many years to come, bitcoin has been the number 1 digital asset for investors, especially those looking to invest in the long-term. When big money started entering into the crypto space, bitcoin was the first stop before it diversified into other assets. However, as time as gone by and more altcoins are beginning to gain popularity, bitcoin is losing its hold as the number 1 choice for investors. A recent survey that featured respondents from the ultra-wealthy class showed that they did not favor bitcoin as their first choice. Rather, they picked an altcoin whose growth has rivaled and even surpassed that of bitcoin since its inception. Ethereum Comes On Top Crypto.com revealed that the wealthy are gradually moving away from bitcoin. Their obvious choice besides the leading cryptocurrency is ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The numbers provided by the crypto exchange showed that ethereum has made its mark on the wealthy. With its broad range of use cases and applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, the value of the cryptocurrency has shot up exponentially. And with that has come more confidence from investors.

3183,2022-01-31,27431301,1643655658,Bitcoin Funding Rates Remain Negative For More Than A Week,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin funding rates have mostly remained negative for more than a week now. If past trend is anything to go by, this may mean that a bottom could be near. Bitcoin Funding Rates Have Now Remained Mostly Negative For More Than Seven Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the Bitcoin funding rates have been negative in the past week for the most part. The &#8220;funding rates&#8221; is an indicator that measures the periodic fee Bitcoin futures traders have to pay each other in order to hold onto their positions. When the value of this indicator is positive, it means long holders are currently dominant and are paying a premium to short traders. Such values occur when the market sentiment is majorly bullish.

It��s not a completely random walk in which the future path is unaffected by previous price fluctuations, but it��s closer than most major assets. Bitcoin Lacks ��Economic Anchor�� Due to its volatile nature and the market-wide correction in crypto, there has been a lot of criticism going around regarding digital assets (especially Bitcoin), all over the internet. The recent one came from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of ��Black Swan��, who sent out a tweet that went viral. He said: ��For a contagion-driven asset with no economic anchor such as #BTC, a falling price does not make it ��cheaper�� and more attractive. A falling price makes it less desirable [and], paradoxically, more [expensive]. Why? Because the price is its only information.�� This is not the case experimentally over the brief history of Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin when the price was falling was just as appealing as buying it when the price was climbing in the past.

At its peak, it only required 14.5 bitcoins for a holder to be a BTC millionaire, much lower than it had ever been in the past. Due to this, the number of bitcoin millionaires rose quickly and tens of thousands of new millionaires were added to the tally. Now, however, with the recent price crash, a lot of bitcoin millionaires have lost their millionaire status. Given that the digital asset has lost almost 50% of its all-time high value, the number of millionaires has dwindled greatly in a short period of time. There Are 30,000 Less Bitcoin Millionaires When bitcoin hit its $69,000 all-time high, the number of bitcoin millionaires shot up quickly. For the first time, there were over 108,000 BTC millionaires given the low number of coins required to reach the millionaire status. All was well for a while and these 108,886 addresses kept their millionaire status. That is until the market crash that began in December 2021 and carried well into January of the new year.

Past Bitcoin Volatility Index Pattern Suggests A Short Squeeze May Happen Here As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC volatility index has now reached values where a short squeeze has happened in the past. The &#8220;volatility index&#8221; is an indicator that shows how much the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated in a day compared to its historical average. When the value of this metric rises, it means the crypto&#8217;s price has recently seen higher volatility as its price has deviated more from its average. On the other hand, low values suggest Bitcoin has been relatively stable lately as the price hasn&#8217;t seen any large movements. Volatility is often high following a liquidation event. These &#8220;liquidation squeezes&#8221; happen when the market is overleveraged, and so any big swings in the price lead to mass liquidations of futures positions.

Related Reading &#124; Terra Announces Non-Profit ��Luna Foundation Guard�� According to Wu Blockchain, the token lost as much as 20% in the last day. Apparently, retail investors have been panic selling their LUNA funds due to concerns about several of its dApps and UST. The latter is one of many stablecoins operating on the Terra ecosystem which is based on a supply and demand mechanism to maintain its peg.

The stablecoin allows holders access to the Anchor Protocol, Terra-based lending and borrowing application that consistently offered its users a 19.5% compounding yield on their UST deposits. This rate surpasses that of its competitors, some of which have issues offering a 10% yield with similar products. However, the current downtrend in the crypto market has heavily impacted LUNA and the Terra ecosystem. Some users believe the ecosystem as a whole could be in danger as a result of a reduction in Anchor��s reserves which according to some projections could reach $0 in the coming weeks.

This is evidenced by the decline of the Fear &#38; Greed Index into the extreme fear territory, reaching as low as 11 on the scale. Investors, understandably, are wary of the market and what the next few weeks, and by extension, months, may hold for them. If this is the beginning of a bear market, then there could be another two-year wait to the next bull rally. Anthony Scaramucci has however urged bitcoin investors not to despair during this time. Despite the market crash that sent the digital asset to six-month lows, Scaramucci, who is the CEO of Skybridge Capital, has told investors to look towards the long-term when investing in bitcoin. The Bitcoin Crash Is Temporary The CEO was on CNBC��s Squawk Box to talk about the crypto market. In this interview, Scaramucci shared some insight into how he viewed the market and the current crash, which he does not believe is a cause for alarm. He urged bitcoin buyers to take some time to cool off from the market, advising them to look toward long-term investing instead of what the market is doing right now.

3536,2022-01-24,27427493,1643050836,"Following Crash, Bitcoin Open Interest Declines To Sept 2021 Levels","Following the crash to $35k, the Bitcoin open interest has declined to September 2021 levels. This may suggest that the market volatility will be lesser in the near future. Bitcoin Open Interest Drops To Similar Levels As In September 2021 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has decreased to similar levels as last September following the crash. The &#8220;open interest&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open in the derivatives market. The metric accounts for both long and short positions. When the value of the indicator increases, it means more money is entering into the derivatives market as investors open more positions. The volatility in the price of Bitcoin usually rises in such scenarios as it implies leverage in the market is going up, and so a liquidation squeeze may be coming. On the other hand, when the open interest declines in value, it means holders are closing up their futures positions. The resulting lower leverage environment usually leads to lower price volatility.

Cardano,"Cardano is one of the most widely used types of cryptocurrency, a type of digital currency that can only be used online. Cardano was founded in 2015 and first traded publicly in October 2017 for a few pennies per token. The currency is now worth more than $1.20 in January 2022, after having peaked at more than $3 in the previous 52 weeks. It is one of the top ten most valuable cryptocurrencies in total value. Cardano was established by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, another renowned cryptocurrency, and it uses blockchain technology to run on a decentralized public ledger. Like an unending receipt, Blockchain administers and monitors the cryptocurrency, documenting, and arranging every transaction that occurs with it. This decentralized mechanism validates transactions, checks their integrity, and aids in the system��s overall stability and error-free operation. In addition, Cardano has a ��proof-of-stake�� method, in which currency owners are entrusted with verifying transactions in exchange for a reward. This ��staking�� incentive might be a fun way to get money. What Is the Origin of Third Generation Crypto Cardano Coins? According to CoinMarketCap, there were approximately 33.5 billion ADA in circulation as of January 2022. Therefore, the entire supply of coins is limited to 45 billion. Cardano is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a fixed quantity of 21 million units.

Of course, bitcoin (BTC-USD -7.2%), which is seen as a proxy for MSTR stock, is falling well below its $40K key level to five-month lows. Specifically, the SEC objects MicroStrategy (MSTR) from using non-GAAP principles to show what its income would have been if it didn't have an impairment charge, Bloomberg notes. Note that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is classified as an intangible asset under GAAP principles, meaning companies that don't qualify as investment firms record digital assets at historical cost and only adjust it if its value declines, Bloomberg cites the SEC's letters.

Coins Matured To 12-18 Months Revisit A High Not Seen Since 2 Years As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC hodlers have held strong recently as coins aged 12-18 months have seen a sharp spike recently. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Bitcoin Sum Coin Age (SCA) Distribution that shows the distribution of coins among the different holders in the market. The metric works by looking at each coin on the chain and measuring how many days it has been since it was last moved. Based on the age, these coins are put into different categories. For instance, if a coin has been sitting still since 12-18 months ago, it is included in the 12-18 months holder group. When the distribution of the long-term holders goes up, it means accumulation has been strong recently. Such a trend has usually been bullish for the price of Bitcoin as it shows a large number of holders refuse to sell at the current levels. On the other hand, when coins belonging to short-term holders move up, it means some long-term holders have decided to sell. This trend may be bearish for the price of the crypto.

The country&#8217;s Central Bank suggested that the trading of cryptocurrencies must come to a stop immediately. In the report put forth in an online press conference, the Russian government along with the Bank of Russia suggested this regulatory measure. This blanket ban on cryptocurrency was tied to risks of financial instability and rising illegal activities. The digital asset apparently posed a serious threat to the sovereignty of Russia&#8217;s monetary policy. Russia holds the third rank in bitcoin mining after US and Kazakhstan. This recent ban on cryptocurrency comes right after the Central Bank of Russia displayed interest in securing information from commercial banks in respect to private money transfers. It also specified that the information collected will comprise of details of individuals who have previously traded in cryptocurrency, not only within the country but also outside of it. Despite Russia legalising cryptocurrencies in the year 2020, it always remained sceptical in regards to accepting the same as a medium of exchange. The report stated that this measure of banning crypto might after all be in favour of Russial as this decision happens to be the &#8220;best&#8221; and &#8220;optimal&#8221; one that safeguards Russia. &#8220;Cryptocurrencies: Trends, Risks, Measures&#8221; In the report, &#8220;Cryptocurrenc...",https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/russia-just-suggested-a-blanket-ban-on-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Crypto|bitcoin|crypto ban|Russia crypto ban,BTC|Fiat|Mining|Exchange|Trading,russia suggested blanket ban bitcoin cryptocurrency,-0.5574

Starting only one year ago, DOGEUSD passed the one cent mark and embarked on a meme-fueled moon mission toward $1. It never quite got there, and has been in a downtrend ever since. The downtrend has also since taken a walk down a dangerous path, putting the altcoin in jeopardy of another deadly drop. Here is what could be in store for Dogecoin in the days ahead. Crypto House Training: Good DOGE, Bad Behaviors There are two sides to every coin, and even a good dog can behave badly at times. Dogecoin was last year&#8217;s cryptocurrency all-star, rising from under a penny to nearly $1. It even managed to crack into the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. It also caused a whirlwind of imitators. Fans of the popular pup-based coin range from Snoop Dogg to the Dogefather himself, Elon Musk. These celebrity figures and the masses of the mainstream rode the Dogecoin rocket to success. Robinhood investors rejoiced; meme-coins went viral on TikTok.

Why Bulls Need To Defend This Level,"On-chain data shows about 70% of the total Bitcoin supply is currently in profit, a level that has historically been important for bulls. Around 30% Of Total Bitcoin Supply Is Now Underwater As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of BTC supply in profit has now fallen off to just 70%. The &#8220;percent of supply in profit&#8221; is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that&#8217;s currently in the green. When the value of this metric increases, it means more coins have started to get into profit. This leads to holders becoming more probable to sell their coins in order to harvest their gains. At very high values of the indicator (more than 95%), the price of Bitcoin has usually approached a top as profits are realized. On the other hand, when the metric moves down, it means more coins are entering into the red. Below certain low levels, investors may capitulate to cut their losses. However, when more than 50% of the supply is underwater, bottoms have historically formed.

A large number of people have invested billions in this industry and the boom is not stopping. Recently, NewsBTC reported an aggressive surge in the NFT trading volume this year despite the falling crypto market. A report by Dappradar showed that in the first ten days of January, NFT trading generated around $11.9 billion. Our previous report quotes Mason Nystrom, a senior research analyst at Messari, who alleged that ��The cryptomarkets are fairly correlated ? the market tends to rise and fall with Bitcoin. This has made it surprisingly interesting over the recent downturn as the NFT market has continued to increase in volumes.&#8221; However, the rapid rise of the NFT space has not moved the officials of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to shed some light on the taxation parameters for the assets. Even taxation experts are confused on the matter and can only speculate about the possible outcomes. As a large share of NFT traffic comes from the younger generations, are users prepared for tax filing season? The IRS is gazing at future penalties.

Just 12% Of Bitcoin Supply Is Now Held By Exchanges As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the percentage of BTC supply stored on exchanges has now dropped down to just 12%. The all exchanges reserve is an on-chain indictor that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently held by wallets of all exchanges. The &#8220;percentage of BTC supply on exchanges&#8221; is a metric that tells us the ratio between the exchange reserve and the total supply of the crypto. When the value of this indicator moves up, it means exchange wallets are receiving a net amount of coins. As investors usually send their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, this supply is often referred to as the sell supply of the market. Therefore, an uptrend in it can be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, when the metric&#8217;s value moves down, it means holders are withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges. Prolonged such trend can imply there is accumulation going on in the market, and the available supply is shrinking. Hence, downwards movement of the indicator can be bullish for BTC.

This seems to be a continuation of the accumulation trend from the last year. The &#8220;miner reserve&#8221; is an indicator that tells us the total amount of Bitcoin currently stored in the wallets of miners.

On-chain data suggests that an uptick in exchange outflows may be behind the move. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Observe A Spike In The Past Couple Of Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange outflows have showed raised values recently. The &#8220;all exchanges outflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin exiting wallets of all exchanges. When the value of the metric goes up, it means more BTC is currently exiting exchanges. Such a trend has usually been bullish as holders usually withdraw their coins to personal wallets for hodling purposes. Prolonged large outflows can be a sign of whale accumulation. On the other hand, when the indicator&#8217;s value stays low, it implies not many investors are moving their Bitcoin off exchanges at the moment. This trend can be bearish if the opposite metric, the inflow, spikes up. This is because holders usually deposit to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins.

Crypto Fear And Greed Index Shows Lowest Value In Six Months As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the fear and greed index reached the lowest values this week since July. The &#8220;fear and greed index&#8221; is an indicator that measures the general sentiment around the Bitcoin and wider crypto market. The metric uses a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred for representing the sentiment. When the values are below fifty, it means the market is currently fearful. On the other hand, values above fifty imply that the market has become greedy. Extreme values of below 25 and above 75 signify sentiments of extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. Such extreme values usually occur around bottoms and tops. Hence, some traders believe it&#8217;s best to sell during extreme greed and buy more crypto like Bitcoin while the sentiment is that of extreme fear. Warren Buffet believed in this idea, as suggested by a famous quote of his: &#8220;be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.&#8221; Baron Rothschild is believed to be one of the earliest of traders to follow this philosophy. He said &#8220;the time to buy is when there&#8217;s blood in the streets.&#8221; Related Reading &#124;?SOPR Shows Bitcoin Holders Continue To Sell At A Loss, Similar To Ma...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-fear-reaches-six-month-peak-time-buy-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin fear and greed|btc|btcusd|crypto|Extreme fear,BTC|Market,crypto fear reach six-month peak time buy bitcoin,-0.4588

Related Reading &#124; Stellar Network Processes 1.8 Billion Transactions, Was 2021 Its Best Year Ever? According to the post, a Muxed account is one that combines the GABC and 64-bit integer ID to create a ��virtual�� account under a traditional address. Due to its characteristics, a muxed account can be identified within a real account. Thus, if there is a service or product using Stellar to pool multiple accounts, they can now manage them with more ease and will be able to eliminate burdensome issues, such as meme problems. The SDF has called on ��products and services built on Stellar�� to check if the validators are compatible with the new account model and asked them to ��come up with a plan to implement�� muxed accounts into their system.

This behavior is similar to what was seen during the May-June 2021 mini-bear period. Bitcoin Investors Have Continued To Dump At A Loss For A Month Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC SOPR shows that holders are currently selling at a loss. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether coins moved on a given day were sold at a profit or a loss. The metric measures so by looking at each coin on the chain and checking what the price the coin was last moved at. After that, the indicator calculates the ratio between this price and the current price. When the value of the indicator is above one, it means that holders are currently selling, on an average, at a profit. On the other hand, when the SOPR has values less than one, it implies investors are moving their Bitcoin at a loss overall. Finally, there is the case when the value of the indicator is exactly equal to one. During such a period, the market is breaking even on BTC sales.

This could mean that a short squeeze may be coming soon. Bitcoin Open Interest Rises Despite Decline In Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has shown uptrend over the past month, despite the price of the crypto moving down. The &#8220;open interest&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open in the market. When the value of the metric moves up, it means more investors are opening long or short contracts on derivative exchanges. This may mean that leverage is going up in the market, and thus such a trend can lead to higher volatility in the price of the crypto. On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests holders have started to close their positions. A plunge in the indicator happens when Bitcoin makes a strong price swing, forcing mass liquidations of the contracts. Such liquidations cascade together and amplify the price move. This event is called a long or short squeeze, depending on which contracts make up the majority.

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Points At &#8220;Extreme Fear&#8221; As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC fear and greed index has dropped to very low values. The &#8220;fear and greed index&#8221; is a crypto indicator that measures the general sentiment among investors in the market. The index uses numbers to represent the sentiment on a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred. Values of the indicator above fifty mean that the current holder sentiment is that of greed. And values below 50 imply that the market is fearful at the moment. Index values below 25 and those above 75 fall into the &#8220;extreme&#8221; category, signifying extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. The indicator usually remains in the greed zone during bull runs. Extreme greed values have historically signaled that a correction in the price of Bitcoin may be near, and a top could form. On the other hand, values of fear may be there during bearish trends, and extreme fear might imply that a bottom could soon form.

Record-Breaking Bitcoin Price Fractal Found, But Is It Valid? Markets are cyclical and patterns repeat in those markets so often, they can be used to predict the future. Most of the statistically proven technical patterns include some type of geometric shape such as triangles and rectangles. But not all setups are so clear.

When fractals appear, they aren&#8217;t a perfect repeat of the situation before, but can yield similar results. Related Reading &#124; Could Kazakhstan Turmoil Cause Another Bitcoin Hash Crash?

Current Bitcoin Trend Looks Similar To June,"Bitcoin on-chain data shows current trend with the short-term holder SOPR looks similar to that in June. This may mean that a bear period similar to then has started. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Continue To Realize Losses As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Bitcoin short-term holders have continued to realize profits recently, as suggested by the SOPR. This trend may be similar to the one seen in June. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio,&#8221; or SOPR in short, is an indicator that measures the profit ratio of the overall market by looking at the price each coin was sold at and comparing it with the price it was bought at. When the value of this metric is above one, it means holders are, on an average, selling at a profit. On the other hand, SOPR values less than one would mean investors are currently dumping their Bitcoin at a loss. The value of the metric when exactly equal to one would imply that the overall BTC market is currently breaking even. A modification of this indicator is the short-term holder (STH) SOPR. This metric accounts for only those coins that were held for less than 155 days before being sold. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past year: The indicator currently seems to be below one &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has remained below one for a while now, showing that these holders have been selling...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/start-of-bear-period-current-bitcoin-trend-june/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin bear market|btc|btcusd,BTC|Trading|Business|Market,start bear period current bitcoin trend look similar june,0.0

In fact, with the most recent support level breached, BTC dominance could be targeting historic lows. Historic lows in BTC dominance could mean that an altcoin season unlike ever before is potentially ahead. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the metric that weighs Bitcoin against the rest of the crypto space and how it could impact altcoin performance. Bitcoin Continues To Lose Cryptocurrency Market Dominance At one point, there was only Bitcoin. As the industry grew, a metric was born called BTC dominance that made it more clear how much weight the top coin had compared to the rest of the market. Prior to 2017, Bitcoin accounted for as much as 95% of the entire cryptocurrency market, but fell to a low of 35% less than a year later during what is considered to be the greatest altcoin season on record. Related Reading &#124; 2022: The Year The Secular Bitcoin Bull Run Could End After reaching such extremes in 2018, by 2020, Bitcoin had recovered more than two-thirds of the market cap. Dominance topped out near 70% where it sharply reversed all throughout 2021. At the close of the 2021 yearly candle, a several year trading range was officially breached. The well defined range is even more visible in the six-month BTC.D chart.

According to a report by local newspaper Gazeta Express, Kosovo&#8217;s Minister of Economy, Artane Rizvanolli, has decided to ban crypto mining following a recommendation from the Technical Committee on Emergency Measures for Energy Supply.

Bitcoin Open Interest Rises To High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has now reached values where mass liquidations have taken place in the past. The &#8220;open interest&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC futures positions currently open on derivatives exchanges. The metric accounts for both long and short positions. When the value of the metric is low, it means investors aren&#8217;t using much leverage right now. Such values usually result in low volatility in the price of Bitcoin. On the other hand, high values of the indicator suggest that futures contract users are currently using a high amount of leverage. This situation can lead to high volatility in the market as big price swings can result in a liquidation squeeze.

Bitcoin Whales Now Account For 90% Of Inflow To Exchanges As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the exchange whale ratio has risen above 0.9, implying that dumping may be going on in the market. The &#8220;exchange whale ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the total Bitcoin amount of top 10 transactions to exchanges and the total inflows. In simpler terms, the metric tells us how the ten largest transactions to exchanges compare with the total amount of coins moving to exchanges. When the indicator has values lower than 0.85, it means that the ten largest transactions to exchanges (which are assumed to belong to whales) make up for less than 85% of the total Bitcoin inflow amount. Such values have been historically healthy for the market. On the other hand, when the metric reaches high values, it implies the top ten transactions make up for most of the inflows to exchanges. Investors usually move their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes. So, this trend may show that whales are currently dumping as they are moving vast amounts of coins to exchanges.

To help our audience solve the puzzle, NewsBTC decided to gather all of our theories in a single post. China Ban Theory #1: The Digital Yuan CBDC This one is as straightforward as it gets. When China started cracking down on miners, NewsBTC reported: ��As for the possible reasons, Bitcoin Magazine��s Lucas Nuzzi cites the upcoming Digital Yuan CBDC.�� And Nuzzi said, ��They&#8217;re literally rolling out their own coin (a CBDC) that will enable the mass surveillance and unbanking of dissidents.�� 1/ The CCP officially banning #Bitcoin should come as no surprise.
