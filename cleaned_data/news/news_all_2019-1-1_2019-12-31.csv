The weekly support has been confirmed for the time being and our parabolic advance is still intact.We are currently failing to hold support in the $8,500s for our intraday market structure. As we test the failed support we have yet to confirm if it has new found resistance. If we fail to regain the level we can expect to see an intraday retest of our weekly support level in the $8,100s.If the $8,100 level fails, it is entirely possible that we will be visiting the mid $6,000s before buying pressure picks up to push the price. However, if we can sustain support on our weekly $8,100 level, we could ultimately see a test of our monthly and weekly resistance in the low $9,000 level before any meaningful, macro correction takes place.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The zone between $8,300 and $8,400 has a strong point of interest in the previous bear market and we are currently seeing high levels of supply surface as people take profit.If we fail to break the $8,400 level, we can expect to see a retest of $7,400 and potentially even a deeper dive into the $6,800s as this represents another macro, weekly level and has yet to see a very strong test of demand.The overall market structure is incredibly bullish on high time frames, but the immediate market structure on the four-hour and hourly candles could see some volatility as weaker hands get shaken from their positions.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

With this additional extension (the first coming on March 29, 2019), the agency will have until August 19, 2019 to either approve, reject or delay the decision yet again; if it is delayed a second time, the agency will have to reach a final decision by October 19, 2019.This news is the first of many instances in which the SEC has delayed or rejected rule changes that would allow for the world’s first bitcoin ETF to come to market.

Proselytized by the works of Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand, Paul decided to run for Congress in the ’70s following the termination of the Bretton Woods agreement — an international pact that was the dollars final, albeit tentative, tie to the gold standard.Nixon’s decision to withdraw from this agreement would have lasting consequences on U.S. monetary policy and Dr. Paul launched his political career as a crusade against these changes and the danger he saw in the fiat economy that they created.

The price structure is looking fairly climactic and we might see a strong round of selling hit the market that could potentially pull us down to retest the mid-$6,000s.If we manage to crack the overhanging resistance and find support, we can expect to see further price growth as we once again decimate a macro resistance level.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

2381,2019-05-07,1230414,1557266291,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bull Trend Continues as Market Marches To $6K Level,"   Summary:Bitcoin’s strong uptrend resumes as, once again, the market has claimed new highs in the $5,900 zone.Our market structure remains bullish as we have consistently created higher highs and higher lows. Specifically, the market structure has progressed in a sort of stair-stepping fashion that has created multiple zones of support that have been tested several times on the 4-hour time frame.On a macro scale, we are in the process of beginning to test daily resistance, but we haven’t truly encountered the weekly resistance just yet. Weekly resistance lies at $6,150 — this is a level that will likely encounter a perfect storm of early bulls (individuals who bought in 2018 and might be looking to break even by selling their bitcoin) combined with profit-taking bulls who rode the trend from the $3,000s, as well as eager bears who are looking to open short positions.At the moment, the market is finding support on our current 4-hour level, but in the event we see a pullback, we can expect to see the stair-stepping support levels we created to stifle any impulsive moves to the downside.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

2382,2019-05-07,1230415,1557266036,Bitcoin Transactions Spike in April While SegWit Keeps Fees Low: Report,"  Research has shown that the number of on-chain Bitcoin transactions has risen dramatically throughout 2019, nearing the volume of Bitcoin’s peak in December 2017. Even so, transaction fees are a fraction of what they were around bitcoin’s all-time high, likely due to the continued uptick of SegWit transactions on the network.These findings were published in the May 6 edition of digital asset publication Diar. Among other research related to DApp adoption on Ethereum, Diar found that fees rose 200 percent in April versus March. Still, fees are negligible compared to the $30 some users paid during the peak of bitcoin’s price climb at the end of 2017, and transaction times are 84 percent lower, as well.Diar reports that this is mainly due to the growing impact of SegWit on Bitcoin’s transaction landscape. The data platform estimates that on average, the protocol is used in 35 percent of blocks and thus is “alleviating fee pressures.”“2018 average SegWit usage was only 26% and only 11% at Bitcoin’s peak highlighting the continued adoption by major players,” it notes.Source: DiarActivated in late 2017, Segregated Witness, or SegWit for short, is designed to alleviate some of the scalability concerns created by blockchain size limitations and, by extension, fees and transaction times.

Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, published on April 30, 2019, “Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef allegedly ran a shadow bank that processed hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated transactions on behalf of numerous cryptocurrency exchanges.”The D.A. also claimed that both individuals ran an organization that managed to evade the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws that govern the operations of licensed financial institutions.The Department of Justice also released court documents, claiming that the two worked for various companies that provided currency banking services to crypto exchanges and then went on to establish and operate an unlicensed money service between February and October 2018. Prosecutors believe that during that period, the two of them created and used several bank accounts with different financial institutions.To get the banks to open these accounts, Fowler and Yousef were said to have made several misleading statements to the banks, claiming that their accounts would be used to conduct “real estate transactions,” while actually using them to transmit funds for a cryptocurrency-related money transmitting agency.To cover up the nature of their business, they allegedly went on to falsi...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/indictments-issued-for-two-individuals-running-shadow-banking-operation/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cbaaxB1M140.jpeg,Bitcoin|Law & justice,Fiat|BTC|Business
2449,2019-05-01,1207673,1556743817,Percentage of CoinJoin Bitcoin Transactions Triples Over Past Year,"  According to a study released by Longhash on April 29, 2019, the relative usage of CoinJoin out of all bitcoin transactions has tripled in one year, currently sitting at 4.09 percent.Source: LonghashCoinJoin was first proposed in mid-2013 as part of many solutions to solve the issue that bitcoin transactions are not genuinely anonymous. Considering that transaction histories can be easily traced on the public ledger, anyone with the technical know-how and resources can perform transaction analysis to de-anonymize users.CoinJoin works by allowing multiple users to pool their individual transactions into a single, grouped transaction. This, in turn, scrambles the funds in this pool to obscure the link between sending and receiving addresses. This shuffling greatly improves anonymity and has become a favorite of privacy-minded bitcoiners.Longhash’s report acknowledges that several early spikes in the relative prominence of CoinJoin-type transactions can be attributed to early tests of the technology and the release of Shared Coin integration in 2013. These experiments ended, and Shared Coin integration was shuttered in 2014, so these spikes have diminished significantly.One of the greatest boosts to CoinJoin adoption so far has been the advent of Wasabi Wallet: The company’s introduction to the crypto industry is now largely responsible for more than one out of every 25 bitcoin transactions using CoinJoin technology.SourceFirst...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/percentage-coinjoin-bitcoin-transactions-triples-over-past-year/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cg0c7y40iF0.jpeg,Bitcoin|Privacy & security,BTC|Market|Trading|Technology|Wallet

In the course of his various peer-to-peer transactions, FinCEN claimed that Powers exchanged a total sum of BTC worth approximately $5 million, carrying out individual transactions worth more than $10,000 over 200 times.Though FinCEN noted that this is its first enforcement action against a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange, this is not the first prosecution of this sort lately. Earlier this month, Jacob Burrell Campos was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for similar crimes, acting as an unregistered exchange. A key difference between the two cases, however, is that FinCEN quoted a civil penalty of $35,350 dollars for Powers while Campos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fincen-issues-first-ever-civil-penalty-against-bitcoin-exchange/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cV1cg2b38M0.jpeg,Bitcoin|Regulation,Exchange|BTC|Regulation|Fiat|Business

The low timeframe has the market consolidating upward with higher lows and higher highs in conjunction with decreasing volume. The next macro resistance level lies at $5,600.If the market fails to rally, we can expect a retest of the established support at $4,700.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The upward drift is bringing us slowly to a level that was previously rejected violently:Figure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Upward DriftOur third rejection of the red resistance level shown above brought the market into a test of macro support in the mid-$3,000s. After several tests of the support level, the market began to slowly drift upward in a stair-stepping manner. This upward drift is a change of character in price action. Prior to this drift, the market was quite volatile, with both upward and downward impulses. The three prior rejected tests shot into the level aggressively (a sign of strong demand) but got spat out aggressively (a sign of strong supply). Our fourth time is quite different, though — rather than shoving into the level aggressively, it is slowly grinding. Slow upward grinds are often a sign of weakening supply and persistent demand.So far, our market has managed to hold macro support and has even managed to hold above the previously rejected level (outlined in black in Figure 1). Now, we are beginning to see the real test of supply as we enter the prior levels that were rejected:Figure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Prior Rejected LevelsIf we look at the rejected levels individually, we can form discrete layers of resistance that the market will need to overcome if the bulls are going to overwhelm the ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-slow-upward-drift-tests-market-supply/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cQc6303NP0M.jpeg,Bitcoin|Investing,Market|BTC|Trading

The level was tested three times prior and immediately rejected. Now, for the fourth time, we find ourselves situated above the level as we wait to see if our support holds:Figure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Fourth Test of Macro ResistanceThe first three attempts to hold support above the black, broken resistance have been stifled with relatively high amounts of volume. However, something to note is that the three rejections of the overhead resistance have become weaker and weaker. Now, on our fourth attempt, we are doing so in a very meandering/drifting manner. Typically, impulsive moves (like the last three attempts) react with impulsive moves in response to the strong move into the level. Grinding moves, however, (like the fourth attempt we are currently experiencing) are often tactics used to trap early shorters and not allow them an opportunity to exit. This sort of position stacking often leads to a “short squeeze.”A short squeeze occurs when the market stacks a large amount of people trapped in a position without an opportunity to exit. As the market drifts upward, more and more people continue to short the market expecting a pullback.

If passed, the measure will go into effect on September 1, 2019.In its current form, the text of the bill itself is brief, providing very few clues as to how such an ambitious task will be carried out. Apart from definitions of basic terms, the bill’s most concrete requirement is that “before accepting payment by a digital currency, a person must verify the identity of the person sending payment,” with an exception to be made if both parties are already using “digital currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known before a person has access to another person’s digital wallet.”The bill also lays some vital groundwork for developing the tools to eventually carry out this plan. It indicates that, if passed, it would have “the Texas Department of Banking, Credit Union Commission, Texas Department of Public Safety, and State Securities Board” collaborate to develop the identification tools, and in cooperateion with law enforcement agencies.Regulators in several countries have had an ongoing struggle to reckon with this technology and integrate it into their financial regulations and legal systems.

Hopeful torch bearers respond to the tweets with a lightning network invoice, and after choosing a user to trust, the current holder adds a discretionary amount to the payment’s sum and sends it to the next holder.The experiment has been making an impression on the community; so far, Andreas Antonopoulos has been in on it, and most recently, at the time of this writing, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey even took up the flame from Matt Odell.

Ortiz took control of the identities of over 20 people, stealing a total of $5 million in cryptocurrencies with his SIM swapping technique. He pleaded guilty and accepted the plea deal of 10 years jail time.How SIM Swapping WorksSIM swapping is a technique that involves a criminal contacting the service provider of a target victim. The hacker will then use personal information acquired about a potential target to persuade the service provider to effect a phone number transfer from the current SIM card to one owned by the hacker. As soon as the swap has been executed, the hacker can request sensitive information including verification codes, one-time passwords and two-factor authentication entries, which are usually sent to a user’s mobile phone as part of a successful porting process. SIM swappers are known to target high-security online domains such as social media accounts, email addresses, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.Other High Profile SIM Swapping CasesVarious SIM swapping cases have been reported lately, including Dawson Ba...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/hacker-gets-10-years-first-sim-swapping-sentencing-us/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/e8M3H0gyu1y.jpeg,Bitcoin|Law & justice,BTC|Regulation|Fiat

According to the report, simply called the Crypto Crime Report, the groups generated around $1 billion of hacking revenues for themselves so far.“Hacking dwarfs all other forms of crypto crime, and it is dominated by two prominent, professional hacking groups,” the report states. “Together, these two groups are responsible for stealing around $1 billion to date, at least 60% of all publicly reported hacks.”HacksExchanges, wallet providers and other custodial services have been prime targets for cybercriminals for years.

Mallers also spoke with Bitcoin Magazine to elaborate on some of the inner workings of the project.Zap’s new PoS protocol was recently put to the test at a Chicago cocktail lounge, uploading the menu onto the app and allowing customers to use a QR code for tipping. Mallers built a device to allow the establishment to run the app, a “Rock64 board (4GB ram) with a Samsung SSD (1TB).” Mallers said that the current hardware rig “is very similar to a Nodl (nodl.it) device” and that “the founder of Nodl (ketominer) was very helpful with advising the build out of the box.”Self-sovereignty was a huge design concern for rolling out this app, so for the final product “total costs for the device hardware were under $200, and that was non-manufactured and ordered from Amazon. This allows the merchant to be fully validating, always online, and not reliant on any third party. The most powerful position any merchant can be in.”Looking forward, Mallers said, “I&#x27;d like to help Bitcoin enter a more consumer-facing era, and build this new relationship with end users via the Lightning Network.

If you haven’t read that article, you should probably do so first.If Taproot is deployed on Bitcoin, many smart contract constructions will look just like regular transactions on the blockchain. As long as all participants agree on the outcome of the contract — a “cooperative close” — the clever combination of Schnorr and MAST offers both data efficiency and privacy.However, if a Taproot smart contract is complex enough — that is, if there are many potential outcomes — the Merkle path that needs to be revealed in case of an uncooperative close would still be data heavy.A follow-up proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell, “Graftroot,” could provide similar benefits as Taproot but without this downside, offering even more smart contract flexibility.GraftrootWith Taproot, all participants combine their public keys to create a “threshold public key,” from which they can spend with their “threshold signature.” For Graftroot, all participants create such a threshold public key as well. But this time, they do not tweak this threshold public key.The participants do create the different scripts: the alternative conditions under which the money can be spent. But, in this case, they all sign the different scripts to create threshold signatures for these scripts.

Even the most complex smart contracts would, on the blockchain, typically be indistinguishable from regular transactions.While a big undertaking, this is not just theory. Several of the most prolific Bitcoin Core contributors — including Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns, Johnson Lau, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and, indeed, Gregory Maxwell — are working on a Schnorr signature proposal that would include Taproot, all in one protocol upgrade.Here’s what Taproot is and how it works.MASTAll bitcoins are essentially “locked up” in scripts: a couple lines of code embedded in a transaction included in the blockchain, that define how the coins can be spent in the next transaction. Spending conditions usually involve providing a signature to prove ownership of the coins. But other, well-known conditions for example include timelocks (coins can only be spent after a specific block height or date) or multisig (coins can only be spent if some number of private keys out of a set of private keys provide signatures).Different conditions can be mixed and matched, to create complex types of smart contracts. An example of such a c...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/eo0g0000000.jpeg,Bitcoin|Technical,BTC|Blockchain|ICO|Trading

It is getting attention and attracting participation in different ways, whether it is through speculation, investing and sending money, all the way to contributing to what’s underneath the hood. The entire Bitcoin repository is on GitHub, inviting any developer to see the protocol’s code and perhaps contribute toward solving existing problems if they can.A noteworthy fact, however, is that the pool of developers today is quite small.“It&#x27;s not an easy field to get into,” Jimmy Song, author of Programming Bitcoin and instructor at Programming Blockchain, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Interestingly enough, the thing that makes Bitcoin hard to get started on is the cryptography, and that&#x27;s hard because the math is not familiar to developers. Specifically, finite fields and elliptic curves.”Some would argue, though, that the small number of developers in Bitcoin today is not too small. In fact, it’s perfectly fine at the size it is for such a new industry.“Bitcoin has only been around for 10 years, and it only started getting a lot of mainstream attention in 2017, so it hasn&#x27;t been a long time to build up an ecosystem of developers,” said John Newbery, a Bitcoin Core developer and Bitcoin engineer at Chaincode Labs.“It’s something that we hear a lot, that it is difficult to find experienced Bitcoin engineers … [Bitcoin] really only s...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/educating-next-wave-bitcoin-developers/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/fSw41a2M30e.jpeg,Bitcoin|Adoption & community,BTC|Blockchain
