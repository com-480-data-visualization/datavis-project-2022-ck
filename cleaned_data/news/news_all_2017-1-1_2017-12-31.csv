875,2017-10-04,9357,1507149345,Coinbase Unofficially Under CFTC Scrutiny for Ethereum Flash Crash,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which earlier this year sued a trader for allegedly running a $600,000 bitcoin Ponzi scheme, is now investigating Coinbase for the Ethereum “flash crash” that occurred on its Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) on June 21 this year.According to a report from Bloomberg, Ethereum prices dropped from about $317.81 at the time, to only $0.10 in a split second, before quickly recovering to the $300 mark once again, in only a few seconds. Per Bloomberg, the CFTC is focusing on understanding what role margin trading might’ve played in the cryptocurrency’s crash, as at the time Coinbase’s GDAX allowed traders to use burrowed money to leverage their positions.Coinbase, which notably claims to have over 10.6 million users, and to have facilitated $20 billion in digital currency transactions, is currently regulated in various states through a patchwork system, but isn’t registered with the CFTC. Following June’s flash crash, it discontinued margin trading on GDAX.The CFTC’s investigation should come as no surprise. As covered by Core Media, the agency is committed to FinTech innovation and is going to pay careful attention to scammers misusing the cryptocurrency, according to the agency’s Director of Enforcement, James McDonald.Moreover, according to a report covered by Core Media, complaints against Coinbase surged by 4,700% this year.

This year, over 1.65 million computers were infected with crypto miners, while in 2013 the number of infections was of 205,000.Recently, according to a report published by Slovakian security software firm ESET, hackers have been found to have infected hundreds of Windows serves with a cryptocurrency miner, and managed to make over $63,000 in Monero over three months.According to ESET, the infected machines were in Thailand, Germany, Taiwan, and Morocco, among other countries. These were running Windows Server 2003 and, as such, the hackers managed to exploit them using relatively unsophisticated attacks. In fact, the firm’s report points to widely available techniques, and simple modifications done to open-source software.To create a Monero mining botnet, the hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0, a type of web server software, that was discovered in March. Unpatched machines didn’t close the loophole and, as such, remain vulnerable.

After the fall, JP Morgan bought about €3 million worth of Bitcoin ETNs, reportedly on behalf of its clients. The move, as reported by Core Media, saw a Swedish bitcoin market-maker – Blockswater – file a market abuse report against the banker for “spreading false and misleading information” about bitcoin.Recently, once again, Jamie Dimon decided to share his opinion on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while speaking to CNBC-TV18 in New Delhi, India. Notably, the CEO stated:""Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they're kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down.”Dimon added that he believes governments will eventually crack down on cryptocurrencies and start controlling them by criminalizing their use, forcing them to be used only on black markets.“Creating money out of thin air”Jamie Dimon also criticized bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for not being fiat currencies backed by a central bank. He stated:""Wit...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/954-jamie-dimon-swings-at-bitcoin-again-says-its-worth-nothing,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/cal42FGA3mE.jpeg,Blockchain News,BTC|Trading|Fiat|Market

The difference between the two is important to note, for one is using only local coin daemons and the other is using hosted electrum nodes.After JL777’s trade, another Komodo team member with the handle “cipi”, made his own atomic trades using the Electrum servers, further confirming its legitimately.  Atomic swap cross-chain trading refers to a trade that bypasses a medium of exchange and trades directly with another coin without the need of a centralized exchange. Atomic swaps have been well established by the Komodo team for quite some time with 100’s of atomic trades already made by the team. Now, the team is moving the technology further by creating atomic swaps using hosted nodes.These hosted nodes, named “Electrum” servers, allow users to interact with the cryptocurrency at hand without having to download and broadcast the whole blockchain. As you can imagine, for wallets that allow multiple coins to do atomic swaps, it is imperative to create a method that bypasses downloading the blockchain. Some blockchains can take days to download and may use up a lot of hard-drive space. Bitcoin’s blockchain, for example, has passed the 100GB mark. Local coin daemons refer to a local wallet with a fully downloaded blockchain.JL777, head coder of...",http://coremedia.info/blockchain-news/item/953-breaking-komodo-successfully-makes-atomic-swaps-using-only-electrum-servers,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/coremediablockchain/800z20w0000.jpeg,Blockchain News,Blockchain|Exchange|BTC|LTC|Technology
