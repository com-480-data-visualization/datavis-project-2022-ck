0,2018-12-31,738246,1546296405,Bitcoin’s Institutionalization: Dates to Watch in 2019,"                        It’s been over a year since the Cboe and CME listed the world’s first bitcoin futures contracts, the first ever bitcoin investment product to hit the legacy market. Both futures went live just before bitcoin peaked at its $20,000 all-time high.

Instead, it’s been a Sisyphean struggle to give Wall Street an easier in, perhaps best exemplified by the industry’s repeated trial and failure to get an ETF approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Still, there ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoins-institutionalization-dates-watch-2019/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/a0g080009w0.jpeg,Bitcoin|Investing,BTC|Market|Exchange|Trading|Business

Support currently appears to be established in the mid-$3,000s as the market remains indecisive over its next move:Figure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Current Support LevelFigure 1 shows the relevance of the current support level as it represents a previous support level that was never properly retested during last year’s parabolic bull market. At the moment, we are currently seeing some resistance around the macro, 78% Fibonacci retracement of the parabolic run-up. To date, bitcoin has realized a whopping 82% devaluation from its all-time high to the current low in the mid $3,500s. If our current support holds, we should expect to see a battle over the 78% retracement values where, if the overhanging retracement level breaks, we will likely encounter another level of resistance in the $5,000 region. But, for now, the market needs to tackle the 78% Fibonacci before worrying about the overhanging resistance levels.On the lower time frames, we can see bitcoin is finding nice support on its 23% retracement which also happens to be the previous high:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Current Low Time Frame Support LevelThe lower time frames are consolidating on top of the previous high and just below the macro 78% retracement.

The service will be available via Huobi’s Derivative Market (Huobi DM) to customers of select countries and will allow them to open both short and long positions for a handful of coins.In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Joshua Goodbody, general counsel of Huobi’s global institutional team, said, “Our derivative contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset on a specific future date and at a specific price.

At press time, Huobi DM is in beta testing mode, and its services are unavailable to users in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

And now, almost a year later, ether sits just above $100 on what appears to be shaky ground during its latest round of selling over the last few weeks:Figure 1: ETH-USD, Daily Candles, Rapid DescentSimilar to bitcoin’s movement discussed in yesterday’s article, ETH-USD experienced a parabolic growth profile during its bull run. One consequence of a parabolic bull run, however, is the lack of firmly established support on the way — which, unfortunately for ether, means no firmly established support to cushion its fall on the way down. In approximately 3 weeks’ time, ether has lost almost 60% of its value.Figure 1 shows the levels of support that have gone untested and the levels of support we have already blown right through. And, depending on whether or not we can hold current support levels, ether may be in for further lows. Figure 2: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Lack of RetracementThe entire move downward over the last few weeks has been so violent, the market has seen little to no relief or rally during the whole 55% drop.

Originally founded in 2014, Tether has seen wide adoption compared to other prominent cryptocurrencies as a popular trading hedge on the industry’s myriad exchanges.There was just one problem with their model, however, in that there was a serious level of opacity regarding their actual fiat reserve. Although a customer could freely change fiat into Tether tokens at a variety of exchanges, there was no way to get fiat back.This prompted speculation into Tether’s business practices, as skeptics wanted to know if there was any concrete way of ensuring that one unit of tether would always be worth $1 USD. Tether terminated its relationship with its first group of official auditors, and it was only later that a law firm could confirm the existence of a cash reserve. This independent examination, however, was not an actual professional attestation or audit per se, but rather what was termed a “transparency report.” This state of affairs was still sufficient for ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/tether-will-soon-allow-direct-redemption-usdt-high-minimum/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/82000000000.jpeg,Bitcoin|Digital assets,USDT|Fiat|Market|BTC|ICO

While incorporating a blockchain element to the supply-and-distribution chain means the development of a data-rich environment, Cargill’s current emphasis in using the technology centers on storytelling. Putting turkeys on the blockchain marks a deeper dive into data development for companies utilizing the technology. “Most people don’t know what we mean by it,” Deb Bauler, CIO of Cargill’s Protein and Salt Division, told Bitcoin Ma...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/your-thanksgiving-turkeys-provenance-might-be-blockchain-seriously/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cMe093M6m2g.jpeg,Bitcoin|Blockchain,Blockchain|BTC|Technology

The approval of this so-called “BitLicense” or “Virtual Currency License” application is the 14th of its kind and is required under New York State law in order for a company to engage in “any Virtual Currency Business Activity.”Under the BitLicense, NYDIG Execution LLC is allowed to offer secure custody and trade execution services, as well as to operate as a custodian for virtual currencies, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, ripple and litecoin.DFS Superintendent Maria T. Vullo approved the request, stating, “Today’s approval further demonstrates that operating within New York’s robust state regulatory system leads to a stronger fintech marketplace and promotes innovation and necessary compliance with effective risk-based controls.” First enacted in August 2015, BitLicense regulations caused an outcry from the community. Some industry companies such as Circle pursued a BitLicense, and others such as itBit (now Paxos Trust Company) received approval to operate as a “chartered trust company” with DFS oversight.

With the scoring model’s data, CryptoIns has calculated rates for their coverage depending on an exchange’s level of security and asset-protection measures.This insurance will be available for assets held on leading exchanges like Binance, OKEx, Kraken and Huobi, while a full list can be found on CryptoIns’ website.“Currently, approximately 3,600,000 BTC are stored in user accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, making this market highly attractive for hackers,” Timofey Volkov, CEO of CryptoIns, explained.Per a recent Forbes article, crypto exchanges are attractive to hackers due to their design: They have a centralized single point of failure, making them prone to the same problems faced by millions of web applications globally.

Once they have the data they need, the hacker will contact the person’s cell phone provider and claim that their SIM card has been lost or damaged and request that a new one be activated, with the end goal of accessing the victim’s finances — in this case, cryptocurrency. The lawyers at Silver Miller Law claim that many of their clients had their crypto wallets drained via SIM swapping techniques, including one individual — an AT&amp;T holder — who had roughly $621,000 stolen despite the phone company’s assurances that security had been beefed up following an earlier hack attempt on his account.

The report details actions for 2018’s fiscal year, which ended on September 30, and offers insight into the ICO-related fraud that has seemingly come to light over the past several months.Misconduct actions against ICOs and similar cryptocurrency ventures are led by the organization’s Cyber Unit, which became fully operational this year. The SEC explains in the report, “We believe our approach to enforcement in this space has been thoughtful and consistent. Importantly, it has provided a template for authorities in other countries, where fraud and misconduct targeting U.S. investors often have been based.” The report regards ICOs as “high-risk investments,” as many “lack viable products or established track records.” The document also says that many contain shady business models or are unable to safeguard digital assets from theft by hackers, while others are completely fraudulent and operate under the guise of garnering business capital. Since the formation of the Cyber Unit, the SEC’s actions against cyber-related misconduct has increased heavily.

The SFC granted that there are many inherent risks in investing in a new space like cryptoassets and set out to address these risks through new regulatory action.The statement showed a willingness to adapt the existing regulations around investing to conveniently and decisively affect crypto as well, staying away from either making these sorts of assets a specific new class of assets or attempting to discourage virtual assets altogether.Unlike mainland China, which has displayed a certain aversion toward private cryptocurrencies, the autonomous region of Hong Kong is apparently taking a different approach. This has led many crypto companies to move out of mainland China, choosing instead to ramp up operations within the region of Hong Kong alone.This stance of adapting the laws to include virtual assets and asset funds reflects an attitude that the economic model of investments and transactions is still fundamentally the same, with the main dangers coming from the uncertain atmosphere of new crypto markets.In addition to releasing the statement on their general intentions, the SFC also released a circular for intermediaries on the same day.

Wex, a Russian-based cryptocurrency exchange, has had a troubled history, to put it mildly. Going formally under the name of btc-e, it drew community unrest when its alleged operator, Alexander Vinnick, was arrested. It subsequently rebranded to the current name and set up a New Zealand-based server. People using this exchange have reported being unable to actually use or withdraw their money, with a dedicated website of aggrieved users meeting to share information about possible allegations of theft. Per the CEO of Binance’s Tweet, it seems as if large amounts of this missing money is being moved through Binance, presumably for the purposes of fraud. To this end, Binance has agreed with the general consensus that criminal activities could be involved.  The CEO went on to state that circumstances such as this are often an unpleasant point in favor of increased centralization for cryptocurrency, as someone does have to be on the hook to help stop fraudulent activity.

This is an important sign of approval by the Korean government regarding GOPAX’s cybersecurity infrastructure.K-ISMS certification is an official domestic standard regarding the establishment, management and operation of information security systems for selected industries including server hosts, portal services and internet service providers. Based on Article 47 of the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection (“the Network Act”), the certification carries significance for the blockchain sector as it signals that blockchain companies possess the capacity to manage and operate information security systems at a level on par with much more established corporations and businesses, specifically those in the technology and financial sectors.

The goal is to expand the decentralized app ecosystem while financing developers who build the most popular applications.Patrick Stanley is the head of product growth at Blockstack. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, he says that app mining is a system where developers are rewarded by Blockstack and other participating companies for creating platforms that community members actually want. The stronger and more popular an app is, the more money the developer will earn. “Right now, app mining is an experiment,” Stanley mentions. “App developers bring value and resources to the community. We’re looking to coordinate early on and test out the concepts early. If everything works well, we’d like to transition things to the PAX blockchain.” PAX is short for Paxos Standard, one of several new popular stablecoins. Once an app is created, it is examined by one of Blockstack’s primary app reviewers: Product Hunt or Democracy Earth. Both platforms seek out newly registered applications and place them on Blockstack. They then collect information on the surveyed apps regarding their usability and personnel and rank them depending on their own unique standards. “The idea is to eventuall...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstack-looks-boost-decentralized-app-usage-through-new-app-mining-program/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/fkahyyc0K8w.jpeg,Bitcoin|Mining,Mining|BTC

However, cryptocurrencies are covered only in the sense that an entity issuing a crypto asset is labeled as a business, while the person purchasing it is a consumer. The report asks several questions about different classes (payment tokens, utility tokens and asset tokens) of digital monies to determine whether they can or should fall under present statutes. For example, does the asset in question give the owner an entitlement against the issuer? Is it transferable? Is it scarce, and how is the scarcity controlled? In terms of payment tokens like bitcoin, the report mentions that they are not presently covered by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which is the EU legislation that regulates firms providing services to clients linked to financial instruments like stock shares and bonds.

709,2018-10-22,567951,1540242013,Bitmain Releases Overt AsicBoost Firmware for Antminer S9,"                        Bitmain has finally released its firmware for the popular Antminer S9 to enable what is called “overt AsicBoost.”In a recent blog post, Bitmain explains their rationale for the firmware release, citing that they originally “decided against activating this mathematical function in mining hardware” due to the “uncertainty surrounding the use of AsicBoost.” Bitmain previously released support for AsicBoost back in March 2018 by adding support for it on their mining pools BTC.com and Antpool. This, however, came after the company noticed blocks being mined on the blockchain using AsicBoost. Bitmain had not released firmware support for its own miners until yesterday’s blog post. Now, Bitmain has enabled AsicBoost on its own hardware, calling it “overt” because of the obvious use of AsicBoost when it is being used by miners (by looking at the blockheader in a block, it is easy to tell if the block was boosted). In one week, Bitmain will also release firmware to enable AsicBoost in its other hardware devices, namely the Antminer R4, S9i, S9j, T9 and T9+. What Is Overt AsicBoost?AsicBoost is a technology implemented in ASIC chips used for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When applied to these chips, AsicBoost allows miners to take a “shortcut” to finding a valid block, essentially saving some energy. The technology was originally patented and held by CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke and RSK Chief Scientist Sergio...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-releases-overt-asicboost-firmware-antminer-s9/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cw501k0oa42.jpeg,Bitcoin|Mining,Mining|BTC|Technology|Blockchain

American financial market company CME Group Inc. announced on Twitter early on the morning of Wednesday, October 17, 2018, that its futures products are experiencing rising volume, explaining, “In Q3, Bitcoin futures average daily volume rose 41% and open interest was up 19% over Q2.”This is a massive improvement over just two months ago when CME stated that volumes on the futures markets had been in the hole for three consecutive trading sessions. During that time, CME’s data reported less than 2,500 BTC transactions — down from over 8,000 at the month’s midpoint. This represented a fall of nearly 70 percent over eight days. Now, however, trading is heating up. Per the company’s data, the average daily volume soared above 5,000 contracts in the third quarter, a significant increase from the 3,577 contracts traded in Q2 and a 170 percent hike from the first quarter’s 1,854 contracts.CME also offered data regarding open interest, which accounts for the total number of unsettled contracts held by current market traders. This figure is also significantly larger, jumping from about 1,500 individual contracts in quarter one to nearly 2,900 contracts in the third quarter. This number has also grown significantly from the second quarter, which boasted just over 2,400 separate contracts.

Bitcoin's network is largely dependent on miners, who use a vast amount of computing power (hash rate) to verify transactions, find blocks to continue the network’s ledger and mint new bitcoin — and 74 percent of that computing power currently resides in China, according to the study.The Bitcoin community is privy to this worrisome trend and has been wary of a potential attack that could be spurred by external factors. Controlling 51 percent of the network’s hash rate opens the threat of a 51% attack, a scenario where miners can modify transactions on the ledger for their own economic gain.

The report also highlights blockchain activity in Zug, Switzerland’s Crypto Valley — a moniker it’s earned for its resemblance to the United States’ own Silicon Valley. While Crypto Valley originated in Zug, it has since expanded to include much of the surrounding territories, including the whole of Switzerland and neighboring Lichtenstein. And that moniker seems more relevant now than ever. The report reveals that there are over 600 blockchain-related companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, and that over 3,000 individuals are employed by them. The top 50 listed ventures covered by the report sport a combined market cap of roughly $44 billion, and five startups are valued at over $1 billion each.  To earn a coveted spot in the report, companies were required to meet specific guidelines, the first being that blockchain technology must be part of their core business. The second was that a venture must employ at least one person either in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, while the third was that it must somehow contribute to the growth and expansion of Crypto Va...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockchain-business-crypto-valley-has-doubled-last-year-report/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/egMG0x0A000.png,Bitcoin|Adoption & community,Blockchain|Business|BTC|Market|Technology

More than half of them will be let go, Financial News reported, citing two sources close to the matter. The news broke early today, October 8, 2018. Coinfloor CEO Obi Nwosu confirmed the layoffs but declined to spell out exactly how many employees would be let go. He told Financial News the staff cuts were a normal response to a changing market environment.Following the market’s downturn at the beginning of 2018, a lot is changing in the cryptocurrency business. Since the beginning of the year, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value, and regulations across the globe are heating up. China has been taking increased action to clamp down on all things cryptocurrency, and, in the U.S., regulators are starting to get tough with crypto exchanges, unregistered securities dealers and questionable initial coin offerings. Amidst this shifting landscape, Coinfloor is not the only one to feel the market’s pinch. In September, Jesse Powell, the CEO of San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, said the company was cutting 10 percent of its client services team in a “cost-saving measure,” but denied rumors that the layoffs would amount to any more than that. ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/uks-oldest-crypto-exchange-prepares-employee-layoffs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/8Ted$1a1i1i.png,Bitcoin|Investing,Exchange|BTC|Business|Market|Asia

Osia says it would like to be the platform in which volunteers share their computer power to mine cryptocurrencies, which are then donated to political campaigns of their choice. At press time, the request is in a “public comments” stage.Initially published September 10, 2018, the venture’s request states, “OsiaNetwork would allow volunteers to support federal political committees by ‘pooling’ the processing power of their internet-enabled devices to mine cryptocurrencies. OsiaNetwork believes that enabling individual volunteers to so ‘pool’ the processing power of these devices would allow individuals to support their preferred candidates, which they would not otherwise be able to do.” Osia further explains that volunteers can use any registered device(s) so long as they are actively signed into the company’s website. Mined coins do not go to the volunteers themselves, but rather to the OsiaNetwork pool, which keeps a certain portion for company processing fees while sending the rest to volunteers’ choice campaigns. “Mining rewards will be allocated among OsiaNetwork’s clients proportionately to the number of hashes that each committee’s volunteers generate to solve the block that generates the mining reward,” the company says. “OsiaNetwork w...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/federal-election-committee-asked-consider-crypto-mining-political-contributions/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c8kU40MMkBw.jpeg,Bitcoin|Mining,Mining|BTC

983,2018-09-24,379310,1537822771,Study Reveals Growing Sophistication in Malicious Mining of Cryptocurrency,"                        Several Chinese researchers from Fudan University, Tsinghua University and the University of California Riverside have produced the first systematic study of the malicious mining of cryptocurrencies, known as cryptojacking, unveiling increasing complexity over time. And it doesn't seem as if this trend will die down anytime soon.What Is Cryptojacking?Cryptojacking has asserted itself in the cybersphere as the valuation of the cryptocurrency sector soared over the past 18 months and refers to where a hacker hijacks the processing power of a computer to mine cryptocurrency on the hacker’s behalf. AdGuard reported in November 2017 that over 220 cryptojacking websites were found among the top 100,000 websites according to Alexa. And this trend is not likely to die down anytime soon. As reported by Bitcoin Magazine in March 2018, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre stated that “... it is likely in 2018-19 that one of the main threats will be a newer technique of mining cryptocurrency which exploits visitors to a website.”The phrase “cryptojacking” burst onto the scene when it was found out that The Pirate Bay was experimenting with Coinhive in September 2017 to see if the non-profit could generate more revenue through its website. Coinhive allows you to add a script to a webpage and mine the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) by utilizing a visitor’s processing power. But the admins of The Pirate Bay mistaken...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/study-reveals-growing-sophistication-malicious-mining-cryptocurrency/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/acychAI4ww5.jpeg,Bitcoin|Scams,Mining|BTC|XMR|Business

His academic paper, “Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments,” laid the groundwork for modern cryptography used in securing blockchains and cryptocurrencies. The “private key” and “public key” framework he laid out decades ago is still the basis for how cryptocurrencies are kept secured in wallets.Birth of ElixxirNow he claims to have invented the first blockchain in the world with the capacity to handle all the needs of consumer-scale messaging and payments. The new platform, dubbed “Elixxir,” is reportedly able to process hundreds of thousands of confidential, quantum-resistant transactions every second.According to Chaum, the Elixxir blockchain offers faster and cheaper messaging and payment solutions than all other existing blockchains, with the ability to scale to levels current blockchains cannot dream of.

Known as BTSE, it’s a platform designed primarily to look after markets and OTC trading. The system is unique in the sense that it offers multiple currencies through one book, and entities like the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen all share the same liquidity pool.Co-founder Jack Li spoke with Bitcoin Magazine about how the exchange works and what its overall purpose is in offering a multi-currency platform. “Even though there has been some consolidation amongst the existing exchanges, the industry is still largely fragmented and localized,” he commented. “Our goal in offering a multi-currency platform looks to address some of these issues through the aggregation of liquidity.” Upon registering with BTSE, a user can select their base currency from a list of 18, which includes USD, EUR, KRW, MYR, PHP and many others. Users can then transfer any currency to the platform or trade in their base currency for crypto, while all liquidity is sourced from the same USD orderbook. “Other exchanges that offer multiple books often struggle with liquidity in their secondary books,” Li stated. “This innovation aims to resolve that issue. If a deposit is sent in a currency we do not yet support, it will automatically be covered at system rate.” BTSE also has a marketplace where verified merchants can offer their services and users can choose ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/newest-crypto-exchange-offers-multiple-currencies-one-book/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cM82pNzM6b7.jpeg,Bitcoin|Digital assets,Exchange|Fiat|BTC|ICO|Market

Gox’s historic hack can finally file for reparations.The now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange opened up its claim filing system to corporate users this Wednesday, September 12, 2018. Previously, the system was open only to non-corporate individuals as of August 23, 2018, but with today’s announcement, any entity that lost funds to the exchange can now file for rehabilitation claims.Creditors have until October 22, 2018, to file for rehabilitation, after which point they will be disenfranchised. Established by Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb but later acquired by Mark Karpelès, Mt. Gox collapsed in February of 2014 after an alleged hack. In the ensuing fallout, the exchange, which hosted the vast majority of the world’s cryptocurrency trading, was rendered illiquid, as malicious actors absconded with some 850,000 BTC, worth roughly $450 million at the time. The hack was the most devastating in industry history until Coincheck, another Japanese exchange, lost a staggering $530 million in January of 2018.Given its magnitude, the aftermath of Mt. Gox’s collapse has hung on to the space’s community like an albatross. Even this year, community members theorized that market slumps were caused by Mt.

The additions, economists Dr. Eric S. Maskin and Sir Christopher Pissarides, are professors at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, respectively. They join Cryptic Labs’ Chief Scientist Dr. Whitfield Diffie, who won the 2015 Turing Prize for his contributions to cryptography.Awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2007 for his seminal work in mechanism design theory, Dr. Maskin will bring extensive knowledge of this theory to puzzle out how projects can devise more effective token economics. To Dr. Maskin, unlocking the potential of blockchain technology means finding the proper incentives to drive a business model, and this means looking past the utility of the coins themselves.“As with any technology, it will take time to parse how economic theories will adapt. I believe that the missing element in the blockchain space is an academic focus on applications of the technology beyond cryptocurrencies. This will allow experts to truly understand and demonstrate the potential for the technology to transform various industries,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.Sir Christopher Pissarides, on the other hand, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2010, will provide insight on macroeconomic trends.

While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy features, several cryptocurrency projects have, over the years, launched with the specific goal to improve on them. And not without success. Several of these “privacy coins” are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today.However, as detailed in this month’s cover story, Bitcoin’s privacy features have recently seen significant improvements as well and are set to further improve over the next months and years. This miniseries will compare different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin.In part one: Dash.BackgroundDash (DASH) is among the most popular but also the more controversial cryptocurrencies in the space today.Originally a codebase fork from Litecoin (which is in turn a codebase fork of Bitcoin), Dash was launched by its founder Evan Duffield in January 2014 as “Xcoin.” The project was quickly rebranded to “Darkcoin,” seemingly in reference to Dark Wallet,...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/battle-privacycoins-why-dash-not-really-private/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c0489cVU8ww.jpeg,Bitcoin|Privacy & security,BTC|DASH|LTC|Market|Blockchain

Individuals close with the matter said that Coinbase has sought guidance from BlackRock’s blockchain working group. While Coinbase spoke directly with employees involved with BlackRock’s blockchain arm, the exchange is after the organization’s expertise in legacy markets. The firm has made a name for itself with its focus on hedge funds and ETFs; iShares, its most popular suite of ETFs, for instance, accounted for $1.41 trillion of BlackRock’s assets under management in 2017. It was this knowledge, the inner workings of successfully launching an ETF, that made up the bulk of Coinbase’s and BlackRock’s conversation, Business Insider’s sources claimed. Even so, the sources also stated that the working group didn’t give Coinbase any definitive direction on how it should go about getting a crypto-related ETF off the ground.Established in 2015, the think tank may seem like an odd addition to BlackRock’s consulting services given that Larry Fink, the firm’s CEO, has called bitcoin an “index of money laundering,” saying that its clients have little to no interest in the surroundi...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-eyes-etf-help-blackrock-business-insider-report/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/8u$scf7O6yz.jpeg,Bitcoin|Investing,BTC|Exchange|Business|Blockchain|Market

Together, both ventures are working to create the Casa Lightning Node, a platform designed to solve many problems associated with Lightning Ramp. Debuting in February 2018, the Lightning Ramp was built to help exchanges connect with the Lightning Network, thereby giving millions of customers access to speedy Bitcoin and Litecoin payment options. During the project’s development, several issues, such as those involving key management, were uncovered that got in the way of mainstream Lightning adoption but adding a Lightning node to the mix is expected to resolve many of these problems. In a Medium post, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Ramp Michael Borglin states, “When we met the Casa team, we were surprised to find that they previously built (but did not release) a multi-chain personal device in Q3 of 2017. They learned that without better key management software, personal node devices are at risk of being attacked. That’s why they focused 100 percent on building the best personal key manager on the planet first.

For those who are unfamiliar with how mainstream financial tools are being applied to cryptocurrencies, this episode serves as an ideal primer to become well-informed on the topic.The episode features an hour-long interview with Caitlin Long. A 22-year Wall Street veteran who has been active in the Bitcoin space since 2012, Long is the former chairman and president of enterprise smart contract platform Symbiont and founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition.While discussing the topic of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the hosts examine the opportunities a person has to “invest” in bitcoin without actually using it, such as hosting nodes or even simply having a public key. Largely uninterested in participating in the decentralized project of Bitcoin, these Johnny-come-latelys mainly want to make a quick buck. The episode details two main topics: the exact specifics of these financial tools and some of the potential market risks associated with them. The conversation includes opinions on the possible implications of these financial tools and what they could mean for the success of Bitcoin’s vision.

The country is now blocking access to more than 120 offshore cryptocurrency exchanges utilized for trading purposes by mainland customers.In addition, officials are also looking to shut down websites pertaining to both cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), and to prevent businesses from accepting payments in digital assets. ICOs were initially banned last September and were described as “unauthorized” and “illegal” fundraising activities. That same month, Chinese regulators ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges within the country to cease trading practices. This caused many ICO and cryptocurrency ventures to pack up their bags and move to the neighboring region of Singapore, which boasts more crypto-friendly regulation. Over the past year, nearly 90 different cryptocurrency exchanges and about 85 ICOs have been shut down in China.

The new platform will provide an added layer of security for users’ keys and allow them to make Bitcoin payments directly from their digital wallets.A segment of the patent filing states, “It may be a security concern for users that the private keys of their Bitcoin addresses may be stolen from their wallets. Existing systems do not provide a solution for maintaining security over private keys while still allowing the users to checkout [sic] on a merchant page and making payments using their wallets.”If approved, the system would work by allowing customers to encrypt their passphrases into a master key to create an additional buffer against theft. The master key encrypts customers’ private keys and whatever transactions are made. Once a transaction is complete, the master key is deleted, ensuring no outside party can gain access to the information. A new master key is created for each transaction.Another novel element of the system is its “freeze logic,” which would allow administrators to suspend the system and prevent transactions from occurring in the event of a theft or cyberattack. The patent reads, “At any point in time after the master key is loaded, the system can be frozen. The system can be unfrozen after it has been frozen using keys from the key cer...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-seeks-patent-security-enhanced-bitcoin-payment-system/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/caDOQ2oh4gA.jpeg,Bitcoin|Payments,BTC|Exchange

The government is also developing a new salary system that will allow employees to receive their wages in petro funds over fiat.“As of next Monday, Venezuela will have a second accounting unit based on the price and value of the petro. It will be a second accounting unit of the republic and will begin operations as a mandatory accounting unit of our PDVSA oil industry,” Maduro announced. The petro was introduced through a pre-sale back in February of 2018 as a means to attract foreign capital to boost the Venezuelan economy and circumvent both EU and U.S. sanctions. It was designed to shore up an economy in shambles, as the bolivar has been struck with rampant hyperinflation over the past year. From the very beginning, the currency aroused controversy both in and out of Venezuela. Many in the National Assembly publicly claimed that the currency was potentially illegal and that its white paper lacked sufficient details or offered unscrupulous arguments for its creation. Concerns further arose in the U.S., which led to President Trump’s subsequent petro-trading ban in March of 2018.

The arrangement is designed to give customers a quick and secure money transfer protocol that offers full regulatory compliance.“Pairing Dai to Wyre’s trading engine and global fiat on-ramps and off-ramps will enable nearly-instant movement of funds across borders. By decreasing the amount of time it takes to clear payments, businesses can increase the number of payment cycles, therefore increasing revenue. Remittance platforms or crypto services can also settle instantly in Dai rather than using international wires which can take up to 48 hours,” the release continues.Through the partnership, Wyre now offers prospective users an Access Point Interface (API) to connect their bank accounts to the blockchain through Dai, while taking care of KYC/AML compliance and onboarding concerns. Using the API, users can now trade Dai against many of the world's major fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies including USD, GBP, EUR and more.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Rune Christensen, CEO of MakerDAO, said the alliance would be beneficial to A...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/wyre-adds-makerdao-stablecoin-pairing-global-money-transfers/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c2pg2ig0200.jpeg,Bitcoin|Payments,Blockchain|Fiat|BTC|ETH|Trading

What Last Weekend’s Ruckus Means for Bitmain’s IPO,"                        Over the weekend, information surfaced that could suggest that mining giant Bitmain may be facing an uphill battle as it looks to launch an IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Newly leaked public information reveals that, in its pre-IPO presentation to investors, Bitmain provided insight into its cryptocurrency holdings, which shows that Bitmain unloaded most of its bitcoin (BTC) to accumulate bitcoin cash (BCH) in its stead. In a snapshot of a slide from the original presentation, the leftmost column titled “Digital quantity of money” shows Bitmain’s bitcoin supply decreased from 71,560 BTC to 22,082 from December 2016 to Q1 2018. Over the same period, its BCH holding increased to over 1 million coins. Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream, pointed out that Bitmain has incurred half a billion dollars in losses through its BCH holdings over the last three months alone. Scrutinizing the company further, Mow pointed out that Bitmain chose not to disclose financial data for its Q2 inventory in 2018. The tweet by Mow brings to light that Bitmain reported $1.24 billion in inventory for Q1 2018, while it has not mentioned any numbers for Q2 despite already being well into Q3, raising speculation that Q2 was omitted because the company may have realized a loss between $600-700 million.In a recent Medium blog post, a pseudonymous blogger by the name of Crypto Herpes Cat points out that these losses, and the lack of tr...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/trouble-horizon-what-last-weekends-ruckus-means-bitmains-ipo/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/fa241000000.jpeg,Bitcoin|Mining,BTC|Mining|Business|Asia

The volume was modest and expansive on the drop as the price managed to lose 25% in value in just 10 days. At the time of this article, the market is testing the strength of the support near the bottom of the macro trading range (TR):Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Trading RangeAs noted in several previous articles, this is a very important stronghold for the bulls. If support does not manage to hold this support, the market will undoubtedly search lower values in an attempt to garner significant market demand. Previously, I discussed the possibility of the recent move to $8,400 as a so-called Sign of Strength (SoS). Typically, a SoS would like to see an approximate 50% retracement for it to be considered a healthy, bullish move. However, in our case, we saw a 100% retracement. Not only did the market move retrace 100%, but the volume and price spread that accompanied the move back to the bottom of the TR was on steady volume and wide candle spread. Steady volume paired with wide candle spread is a sign that the market is lacking demand and that the sellers are overwhelmingly dominating the market:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Selling PressureThe chart above shows just how dominant the sellers were on this latest shove.

But the legal questions behind his conviction and subsequent sentencing to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015, remain fresh, raw and real to Ulbricht’s advocates.Among the people most passionate in their belief that Ulbricht has been given an unfair shake by the American justice system is his mother, Lyn Ulbricht. Her staunch support of her son should come as no surprise, and it’s a stance that has seen her make her case — that Ross was unjustly convicted and sentenced — to audiences of CNN, the Wall Street Journal and international media of every stripe.Lyn now has an unfortunate impetus for making a fresh round of appearances, in the recent denial by the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Ross Ulbricht’s conviction or life sentence. As a guest this week on The Tatiana Show! podcast, Lyn provided listeners not only with an update on the dwindling legal options available to the Ulbrichts but also with an intimate view of the personal costs that afflict the family members of those who have been incarcerated.Almost Out of OptionsThere are many who are unsure of where they stand on Ross Ulbricht, whose online creation employed both Tor (a.k.a.

Prior to the ETF ruling, the bulls continued to show demand as the bitcoin market saw a strengthening rally supported by expanding volume:Figure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Macro Trading RangeShortly after the retest of the trading range (TR) spring discussed in our previous bitcoin market analysis, the price strongly reacted by breaking through notable resistance on expanding spread and volume. Surging out of a spring on expanding volume and spread is a textbook characteristic of a “Jump Across the Creek” (JAC). I won’t bore you with the minutia of TR anatomy, but you can basically think of the JAC (sometimes called a Sign of Strength) as a test of demand after the market has proven to show signs of seller exhaustion. Essentially, the creek can be thought of as a wavy area of resistance that constantly grinds down bulls and wears down their will to continue to buy:Figure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Upper and Lower CreekThe main creek (circled in pink) is a great representation of the general, overhanging area of resistance. In our case, the resistance is perfectly represented by the daily 50 EMA.

Early adopters of this technology have shown excitement for the potential of this inflation-proof sound money. With steady increase in value over the years, this new invention of money has established its position in finance. The gold rush pushed by the price explosion reached its peak at the end of 2017.

Building on the insights of evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who saw money as a “formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism,” Szabo found in the precursor of money the beginning stage of developing tools for cooperation.This astute scholar of money learned how these primitive forms of money, among other functions such as inheritance and insurance against starvation, gave humans a mechanis...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-bitcoins-roots-great-law-peace/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/a0Ea0wwh488.jpeg,Bitcoin|Op-ed|Adoption & community,BTC|Trading|Fiat|Regulation|Exchange

PO8’s model in adhering to responsible salvaging practices convinced the local government officials, as Chief Marketing Officer Raul Vasquez told Bitcoin Magazine: “Currently PO8 is the only government approved entity with a salvage license to do any underwater salvaging in territorial waters belonging to the Bahamas.” Using an Ethereum-based platform along with ERC-721 token functionality, the PO8 model creates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — tokens based on the collateral value of recovered items. Each NFT utilizes specifically designed smart contracts that are cryptographically certified with unique asset data. While NFT ownership can be to anyone in the world, the majority of PO8 artifacts remain in the custody of the PO8 Foundation. “For example, let’s say PO8 finds a rare artifact worth millions,” Vasquez explained. “The physical artifact would remain under...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/deep-sea-treasure-hunting-blockchain/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/81wskt8u61w.jpeg,Bitcoin|Digital assets,ICO|Blockchain|BTC|ETH

Over the last week or so, bitcoin managed to break its sustained downtrend and trend back inside the macro trading range (TR) — both of which are quite bullish market characteristics. However, today’s pullback has us retesting the support of the macro TR (outlined in blue):Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Trading RangeAs noted our previous market analysis of bitcoin, the market has been confined by a well-defined trading range. While it is inherently bearish to push below a trading range, there are a couple arguments that can actually put a bullish twist on the deep test of support. Oftentimes, in accumulation TR, there is a shakeout known as a “spring.” A spring serves not only to trap eager bears but to create liquidity for the more aggressive bulls. One characteristic of a spring is a subsequent retest of the market supply. Typically, the retest will fail to reach the lower low and, ideally, will be tested on decreasing volume. While we are currently seeing a peak in volume, we will have to keep an eye over the next few days and see if the volume falls off as it tests new lows. Fortunately for the bitcoin bulls, a low volume retest of the spring support would correspond to an inverted head and shoulders reversal pattern setup:Figure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Inverted He...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-breach-below-trading-range-may-spark-spring-retest/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/9eiA4tApCMF.jpeg,Bitcoin|Investing,Trading|BTC|Market

Radomski’s journey to improve the gaming experience began 12 months ago in June 2017, when he created code for the first non-fungible token. It was released on GitHub two months later, and it led to the creation of the ERC-721 token, which is widely considered the standard for blockchain-based gaming and digital art. Several decentralized applications (DApps) have implemented the ERC-721 onto their platforms to create a wide array of gaming collectibles. Unfortunately, ERC-721 was found to exhibit several limitations, and Radomski knew he had to take the standard to the next level.“The non-fungible tokens being used today have defined a new class of user-owned virtual items,” he explained. “However, there are many problems with the existing token model. It is very expensive and inefficient to deploy large databases of items that mainstream game developers use.” Radomski explains in a blog post that the new ERC-1155 protocol allows for an infinite number of both fungible and non-fungible items to be deployed through a single contract. It is also lightweight and easy for most networks to handle.“If this does take off, the gaming industry alone will require tens of millions of new items — but the application of this standard is by no means limited to the game...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/enjin-coin-cto-creates-erc-1155-new-token-standard-ethereum/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cY140j4c108.jpeg,Bitcoin|Ethereum,ICO|ETH|Blockchain|BTC

1933,2018-06-21,145904,1529615520,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Shaky Support Gives Way to Massive Bear Flag Set-up,"                        A sideways market has many bitcoin investors wondering if the downward volatility has finally subsided. As stated in our previous discussion of the bitcoin market, the $6,425 support level was a very important level to hold. A failure to maintain support at that price level would undoubtedly cascade the market into a test of deeper support values. Fortunately, the week started off with a decent bounce off the support level:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Support LevelAlthough the volume was not the best, the price managed to rally decently on a fairly wide spread. Currently, the price seems to be bound within a pseudo-trading range of sorts where it is meandering around, testing both support and resistance. Right now, it’s unclear whether this trading range is an accumulation or redistribution trading range, but it beginning to take form as the price ping-pongs around:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Current Trading RangeAt this moment, there is no discernable volume trend that would hint toward accumulation or distribution, which, for me, puts this in a no-trade-zone. If we zoom out to a higher timeframe, there is a strong argument that, because we broke out of such a prolonged symmetrical triangle, this is actually stepping-stone redistribution that will ultimately lead to a continuation of the down trend. We could even argue that current trading indicates a pretty sizeable bear flag:Figure 3: BTC...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-shaky-support-gives-way-massive-bear-flag-set-/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/9eiA4tApCMF.jpeg,Bitcoin|Op-ed,Trading|BTC|Market|Business

After bottoming in the low $6,100s, the SEC news spread and a modest rally on relatively low volume ensued:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Weak RallyAlthough the move was sudden, the overall volume behind the move was poor. You can see on the hourly candles that the volume barely made a noticeable blip on the radar. However, one noteworthy thing occurred during the rally: The price managed to break back into the macro trading range it has been bound by for the last 5-6 months:Figure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Macro Trading RangePart of our previous discussion centered around known support levels and their implications. The first line of support was outlined around the $6,450 values.

Now, at the time of this article, we are testing the support of the $6,450 range again.

The Bloq co-founder unveiled Metronome (MET), a cryptocurrency he founded alongside Matthew Roszak, at the Las Vegas Money 20/20 conference in late October, and the project caught the attention of Bloomberg and Fortune at the time.What makes Metronome interesting is that it promises its users cross-chain portability. It also purports to offer a consistent rate of inflation and “no undue influence from founders after launch.” These three promises — Metronome’s mantra of self-governance, reliability and portability — set lofty expectations for the new company; anyone acquainted with Bitcoin and blockchain technology is likely to watch and see if it can deliver.Garzik has stated in past interviews that he created Metronome as a new beginning, a project that embodies what he would do differently after building on Bitcoin for a number of years. Metronome’s differences seem to suggest that the search for hyper-decentralization was Garzik’s touchstone for starting over. Imagine a coin being so intrinsically opposed to centralization, for instance, that it isn’t beholden to a single blockchain.Of course, as an ERC20 token, it is fundamentally tied to Ethereum; but the team claims that via smart contracts, users can swap the coin from chain to chain.

2015,2018-06-13,144550,1528923152,Op Ed: Scaling Capital Market Adoption of Blockchain Technology With SHA-3,"                        The shift has already started; finance is moving onto the blockchain, leveraging the decentralization and disintermediation benefits of the technology’s architecture.Assets of all kinds are being moved to the blockchain, creating a more efficient and economical system for the transfer of value, and management of fractional ownership. This migration isn’t just disrupting the existing financial system, it’s democratizing access to growth capital across the world. Today, security for much of the blockchain community relies on an outdated hash algorithm standard (SHA-2), one not best suited to the needs of the demanding financial markets. Existing chains will eventually need to upgrade to what our team has determined to be the best-in-class cryptographic hash function, SHA-3, but new blockchains should implement it now. These are the very early days of putting securities on the blockchain. As leaders in crypto-securities and blockchain technologies for the capital markets, we must be thoughtful about how we facilitate this transfer of assets; we must ensure that we operate in such a way that lays the groundwork for long-term security and sets a standard for industry best practices. Implementing the best-in-class cryptographic hash function, Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3), serves this mission. The Hash FunctionBlockchain technology is disrupting the data management industry.

RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo who spoke to reporters said there was a three-month grace period for businesses providing such services to wind down operations.The bank said the move was motivated by the need to protect Indian customers and prevent money laundering.

The new project entitled ICO Hub is an algorithmic ICO rating service that adds identity verification as a central rating factor: Hub representatives will now be able to identify ICO project team members and organizers to ensure a platform’s authenticity before investors step in.Launched by LinkedIn’s original CTO and co-founder Eric Ly, Hub works to establish blockchain histories and reputations by granting users blockchain-specific tokens which they can then add to a platform’s reputation data, thereby building its online market presence.Civic seeks to grant consumers a say in whether their identities are used in real-time by providing low-cost, on-demand and secure identity verification technology that boosts transparency and legitimacy in the crypto space. Civic uses a decentralized structure with biometrics on mobile devices, and provides multi-factor authentication without usernames, passwords, physical tokens or third-party involvement.ICO Hub is built on a specific rating system.

Until this weekend, the market hadn’t decided whether it was going to break up or break down out of the pattern. Over the weekend, the bitcoin market saw a very strong push on very high volume through the bottom support of the triangle:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Symmetrical Triangle BreakdownThe implications of this consolidation pattern breaking down have potentially devastating ramifications for the crypto market across the board. With patterns like a symmetrical triangle, there is a measured move that will give insight into a potential price target that will play out upon the breakout. In our case the measured move is a staggering $5,500 move. If the triangle had broken to the top, we could have expected to see a $5,500 move to the top. However, since we broke to the bottom of this pattern, we could potentially be heading for prices ranging from $1,500 - $3,000. Whether that target becomes fully realized remains to be seen, but those prices are not out of the question.When we look at current support levels that may impede the downward motion, a few tests need to be broken before the full-fledged bearish pressure really begins to manifest in the market.

In a recent interview with CNBC, the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.” Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked. He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.” “Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed. Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s ...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/steve-wozniak-wants-bitcoin-become-worlds-single-currency/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c8_s6SSIOpw.jpeg,Bitcoin,BTC|ETH|Blockchain|Fiat|Business

Maybe bitcoin just doesn’t like Mother’s Day… Still, others remain skeptical that bitcoin will stay at the $7,000 position or spike soon after that.

The institution has partnered with the Latin America–focused exchange startup Bitex — founded in 2014 — to potentially compete with SWIFT, a global, bank-owned messaging network.SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is built to handle and process international bank payments. Unfortunately, the project has been suffering from security issues since it first entered the monetary arena.Banco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to base its cross-border payment system on the Bitcoin network.

2296,2018-05-16,138314,1526504017,"Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes","                        Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with clear progress and updates for its identity attestation technology. The project imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. A new platform user would submit relevant identity information to a validation smart contract, which the validator would then review for approval. If approved, the validator would store references to this information on the blockchain, attesting to its validity. Anytime the corresponding user needs to submit identity information to another service provider (a bank, government agency, etc.), that service provider could request the validator to cross-check the user’s information with the blockchain’s attestations to verify their identity.In practice, such an ecosystem could streamline identity verification procedures and keep its users and participating service providers from having to go through lengthy ID checks whenever the occasion arises.Coming out of Consensus 2018, Civic is showing that it’s taking steps to turn theory into a reality. These steps include the first iteration of its ID codes protocol alongside its revamped token economy white paper, and — the kicker — the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”The idea of giving out free beer may seem kitschy at first glance, but its novelty is matched by what it means for Civic’...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/civic-demos-proof-concept-beer-vending-machines-launches-id-codes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/8jwACw6b8$c.jpeg,Bitcoin|Adoption & community|Privacy & security,Blockchain|BTC|ETC|ICO|Technology

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading RangeUntil last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.Sometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume ViewAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side.

The organization is seeking to label all virtual tokens originally distributed through initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities, which would subject them to very strict regulatory practices and potentially have massive repercussions on their prices.One of those tokens is ether, which was originally distributed and marketed through presales. Members of the Venture Capital Working Group — an organization comprised of lawyers, investors and cryptocurrency experts working to block the SEC’s decision — argue that ether has become so decentralized, it can no longer be looked at as a security, and should thus be exempt from securities-related laws. Ether is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin. April 26, 2018, marked an important step in the fight for “token rights.” A congressional hearing with testimony from the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance (the organization directly responsible for establishing token policies) took place to potentially develop more reasonable approaches toward token sales and their classifications. Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer led the discussion with SEC division head William Hinman.

Since the first week of March, the platform’s Steemit account, EOS Go, has posted weekly reports on the organizations that have submitted themselves for consideration.A mixture of big and little fish, the candidate pool includes upward of 50 different organizations. Some are groups of regional enthusiasts that bear the EOS name next to their home country or city, such as EOS Detroit, EOS Rio and EOS Canada. Others represent blockchain industry movers, such as Bitfinex, Huobi, AntPool, Wancloud and OK Blockchain Capital. As this previous sample suggests, an overwhelming number of candidates competing for the coveted supernodes come from Chinese organizations.Also known as block producers, supernodes operate as part of EOS’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. Under DPoS, validators serve a function similar to that of miners who secure proof-of-work systems. Community members will vote on delegates to represent them on the network, and these delegates are charged with accruing, processing and mining transactions into blocks. They’ll also be responsible for broadcasting these blocks and the network’s distributed ledger to other minor nodes that support the network.In order to keep block producers honest, th...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/eos-hype-builds-over-50-candidates-vie-21-supernodes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c0Oh830kp24.jpeg,Bitcoin|China|Startups,Blockchain|BTC|ETH|Mining|Exchange

Working to change this, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures have gathered a team of lawyers and investors known as the “Venture Capital Working Group” to meet with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop what they call a “safe harbor” for specific digital currencies and establish long-term proposals for how they should be viewed and handled. The New York Times alleges that several regulators are considering placing well-known cryptocurrencies — including ether, the world’s second-largest digital asset — in the securities category, which may cause their prices to fall drastically. Richard Levin, a lawyer who’s worked with various blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures, described the meeting as “crucial” to the safety of digital assets and their respective users. “It’s a ‘come to the lord’ moment,” he explained. “We are seeing a watershed moment in which many firms in the digital asset community who may have been ignorant of the law — or poorly informed — are now coming to terms with the fact that they are subject to regulators.” While details surrounding the meeting...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/venture-capital-working-group-seeks-select-cryptocurrency-safe-harbor/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/ce7fI0wg68b.jpeg,Bitcoin|Regulation,Regulation|BTC|Exchange|Market|Blockchain

Goodman. Later, when Breitman disclosed that he was the real author behind the work, many wondered why he used a pseudonym. As it turned out, at the same time he started working on Tezos, a project that went on to raise $232 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, Breitman was working at investment bank Morgan Stanley. He was also registered as a broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory body with oversight of dealers and brokers in the U.S.FINRA requires registered securities professionals to let their employers know about any for-profit business they are conducting on the sidelines. Breitman, who left Morgan Stanley in 2016 and is no longer registered with FINRA, neglected to inform his employer about Tezos, and the fact he used a pseudonym on the white paper indicates he may have been trying to conceal his involvement.These and other details of the Tezos project were brought to light in October 2017, when Reuters published a full report on the project, thereby putting Tezos on the radar of regulatory bodies, such as FINRA and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Whether keeping with crypto’s anti-establishment roots or for lack of ability, American cryptocurrency practitioners are testing the IRS’s tolerance for crypto tax evasion.Tax day in the United States is tomorrow, April 17, 2018, but according to the popular tax filing service Credit Karma, few cryptocurrency holders have reported earnings or losses on their 2017 tax documents. Out of the company’s 250,000 new filings, under 100 have disclosed capital gains from cryptocurrency investments, figures that are in line with the company’s former reports on cryptocurrency tax documentation.Certainly, Credit Karma’s user base does not constitute the whole of America’s crypto investor populace.

First and foremost, the IRS treats virtual currencies as property, subjecting them to the same capital gains taxes that affect traditional investments like stocks, bonds and real estate.

Although ether is traded on public markets and has displayed price appreciation similar to bitcoin, they are quite different by design. Ether is not intended to be a unit of currency on a peer-to-peer payment network; rather, it acts as the “fuel” or “gas” that powers the Ethereum network.At the highest level, Ethereum is an open-source platform that runs smart contracts. When smart contracts are run on a blockchain, they become self-executing when certain conditions are met. The execution of smart contracts requires computational resources that must be paid for in some way: this is where ether comes in.  Ether is the crypto-fuel allowing smart contracts to run. It provides the incentive for nodes to validate blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, which contains the smart contract code. Every time a block is validated, 5 ethers are created and awarded to the successful node. A new block is propagated roughly every 15–17 seconds. Some nodes may find the correct solution to a block without having it included in the network. The Ethereum network rewards these nodes with 2–3 ethers.Individuals interacting with decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform will have to pay the network in ether for the use. Developers are incentivized to create these decentr...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-ether/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/a0280002828.jpeg,Bitcoin|Ethereum,ETH|BTC|Blockchain|Market|ICO

They’re going to think you’re crazy, but believe it. It’s happening and it’s going to be awesome!”He repeated his bold prediction in a tweet the following morning.     Oops!

It’s clear that bitcoin is useful for censorship-resistant payments that may not otherwise be possible without this new technology, but much more of the recent hype has been around tracking the price more than anything else at this point.Although general activity on the Bitcoin network has continued to rise, a recent report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows that a growing percentage of this activity is related to trading on exchanges.There are a variety of reasons as to why the average person on the street is not interested in using bitcoin for payments. For example, the user interfaces are still hard for non-techies to use, network congestion leads to high fees, and price volatility is not something people are used to dealing with in their wallets (at least in most developed countries).On top of that, one other key issue is often overlooked: capital gains taxes.Who’s Reporting Capital Gains Taxes on Purchases Made via Bitcoin?In the United States and many other countries, capital gains taxes must be paid every time an individual uses some of their bitcoin stash to make a purchase, as long as the bitcoin price has gone up since those bitcoin were first acquired.For example, let’s...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/heres-how-taxes-are-harming-bitcoins-usefulness-payment-method/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/fR2qb2000w8.jpeg,Bitcoin|Regulation|Adoption,BTC|Regulation|Trading|Exchange|Blockchain

The year started with a single bitcoin trading at nearly $1,000, though things ended on a higher note when the currency nearly grazed the $20,000 mark.Since January 2018, bitcoin and other virtual currencies have experienced serious drops in their prices, but Huang is convinced that cryptocurrency remains as popular as ever.“Cryptocurrency will be here,” he stated in the interview while discussing the future of finance. “The ability for the world to have a very low-friction, low-cost way of exchanging value is going to be here for a long time.”NVIDIA is a technology company based in Santa Clara, California.

To those paying close attention, the proposal was listed under “meta,” a hint that this was a meta joke, meant to leave people scratching their heads and wondering if he was being serious or not.

Entitled “Bitcoin Mining Hardware Accelerator with Optimized Message Digest and Message Scheduler Datapath,” the patent was originally submitted in September of 2016, but is now being released for the first time.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining has long been under scrutiny for the excessive energy it allegedly uses.

The patent says the product can decrease energy use by up to 35 percent while lowering financial requirements and mining more bitcoins in the process.The document reads:Because the software and hardware utilized in Bitcoin mining uses brute force to repeatedly and endlessly perform SHA-256 functions, the process of Bitcoin mining can be very power-intensive and utilize large amounts of hardware space.

Get Paid in ShoCoin,"                        Encouraging early adoption is always a hurdle when launching a new technology – especially one that is trying to crack a problem that has been around for decades. ShoCard, which is creating a blockchain-based ID management solution, is using tokenization to help meet that challenge. The company begins its ICO on May 28, and hopes that the launch of its ShoCoin token will provide an incentive for people to use its secure identification app.Personal identity information has value. If it didn’t, why would cybercriminals try so hard to steal it? Until now, centralized sites storing that data didn’t reward people for handing it over. ShoCard CEO Armin Ebrahimi wants to change all that with a token-based system that allows people to compensate each other for what they share.Using ShoCard’s mobile app, people encrypt their identity information and share it with third parties ranging from banks to airlines and even their local bartender. A digital hash of that information stored on the blockchain proves that it is legitimate. The system enables individuals to keep hold of their data rather than leaving it in someone else’s potentially insecure database.Stakeholders in the ShoCoin ecosystem can reward each other for a range of tasks including creating user identities, certifying users, and sharing those certifications.Some of those tasks are less obvious than others. A bank running a know-your-client (KYC) check...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/sharing-your-identity-get-paid-shocoi/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/cQjcCg0Csw0.png,Bitcoin,Mining|ICO|BTC|Blockchain|Technology

A survey of 1,000 college students with student debt were asked the simple question:Have you ever used student loan money to invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?The results were astounding with 21.2 percent answering in the affirmative.  Although the details of the methodology used in the survey have been kept relatively vague and leave questions as to whether the subset selected could provide a realistic estimation, a case can be madefor these surprising results. But is it possible that a whole fifth of this group — more than 9 million people, have invested student loans into crypto? It’s possible, but not probable — we’re simply going to need more data before we can even consider this number as a reliable estimate.With that being said, a closer examination of the demographic in question may shed some new light on the initial analysis: These students are most likely to be millennials. The average age of students in college is about 24 years old, and 60 percent of them are borrowing money to support their studies. The last four months have seen the cryptocurrency space transformed.

2806,2018-03-26,96253,1522099178,Op Ed: Why Korea Could Be the First Cryptocurrency-Powered Nation,"                        Korea has many of the pieces of the puzzle to become the first “Crypto-Powered Nation,” one that runs on blockchains and supports a crypto economy. Here’s what I learned during an intense two and a half days there in March 2018.Some country out there is going to be the first “Crypto-Powered Nation.” That would be one that has widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, serves as a global hotbed for crypto-innovation, runs enterprise-grade scalable blockchain infrastructure and has a balanced relationship with government.South Korea could be one and it is one place that may be worth watching over the next few years. Here’s why I think so.Cryptocurrency Awareness and Adoption Are Already WidespreadSome estimates put cryptocurrency ownership in the country as high as 33 percent of the adult population. The concept of digital asset ownership is mainstream.

That’s a huge hurdle in the evolution toward daily, mainstream usage. When all is said and done, Korea is the third biggest cryptocurrency market in the world and you ca...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-why-korea-could-be-first-cryptocurrency-powered-nation/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/bzMo212h640.jpeg,Bitcoin|Digital assets|Op-ed,Asia|BTC|Market|Blockchain

2838,2018-03-23,94026,1521841726,“Real Users:” Bitcoin Donations Helped These Earthquake Survivors Recover,"                        This is the second in a series by Aaron van Wirdum focusing on real users of cryptocurrencies. Read about his earlier experiences in Italy here: ""Real Users"": In This Mountain Town, Everyone Knows About Bitcoin.The straight stone road from the partially crumbled city wall to the scaffolded church in the center of the central Italian town of Norcia is empty. It glimmers a bit from the rain; the weather is unusually wet for this region today. Tourists and day-trippers that would usually be strolling around the historic town center on Saturday afternoons like these are nowhere to be seen.Bad luck for Ilaria and Lorenzo. The couple — both in their thirties, both wearing thick coats, scarves and beanies to keep themselves warm — set up a small mobile bar near the end of the street, under a white marquee; the inside is decorated with pictures of flowers. It’s all part of a local street market festival. There, they sell saffron and beer produced with saffron, produced from the thin reddish stalks plucked from the crocus. It’s a delicacy, Lorenzo explains, as he hands out taster-sized plastic cups with beer. “Pound-for-pound among the most expensive products in the world,” he says.It’s been almost 18 months since the Norcia area was struck with a seismic shock of 6.2 on the Richter scale: an earthquake that many of the old brick homes typical of the Mediterranean countryside could not withstand.

2839,2018-03-23,94013,1521840668,Binance Seeks New Home in Malta’s Fintech-Friendly Environment,"                        After facing crackdowns in China and being issued a warning by regulators in Japan, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is now seeking a home on the crypto-friendly island nation of Malta, the company’s CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg.  Malta is known for extending open arms to fintech and blockchain technology. Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat underscored that policy when he shared the Bloomberg piece on Twitter, stating, “We aim to be the global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.”Since it was founded in Hong Kong in 2017, Binance has grown rapidly to become the largest exchange in the world by trading volume. Establishing itself in Malta could open doors to even larger growth. Currently, the exchange is negotiating with banks in Malta to set up a formal banking partnership, Zhao told Bloomberg. If it succeeds, that means Binance, which now offers only crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, will be able to offer crypto-to-fiat trading pairs. In that sense, Binance would operate similar to U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, where users have direct links to their bank accounts and can withdraw and deposit fiat. Banking relationships are essential to the livelihood of exchanges. Without the ability to allow customers to move in and out of the fiat world, exchanges turn to stable tokens, like tether (USDT) or trueU...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/binance-seeks-new-home-maltas-fintech-friendly-environment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c2d02wxE281.jpeg,Bitcoin|Regulation,Exchange|Asia|Trading|Fiat|USDT

After meeting with government officials and partnering with local business leaders, the company is opening the doors of its new energy-efficient, data-mining center, in which executives have already invested $35 million.The center is stationed in the Mo Industrial Park in the town of Mo i Rana and is expected to create roughly 30 new jobs for local workers.CEO Valery Vavilov explained that the country’s innovative spirit and “favorable tax code” made Norway a top pick for Bitfury’s future expansion:Norway is a perfect match for Bitfury’s focus on innovation and growth. We look forward to identifying new customer relationships and designing the products and solutions they need to make their enterprises run more securely and efficiently.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining have long been criticized for allegedly requiring large amounts of power. Cities like Plattsburgh, New York — once popular among bitcoin miners for the low-cost electricity they provide — have already enforced temporary bans or “moratoriums” due to the growing difficulties of satisfying miners’ needs.With energy consumption being a major concern, Bitfury mentioned that the data center boasts a power usage effectiveness (PUE) level of 1.05 or lower, and thus stands as one of the “world’s most energy-efficient” operations.

2842,2018-03-22,93731,1521758138,Bug Caught That Allowed Coinbase Users to Garner Unlimited Amounts of Ether,"                        On March 20, 2018, it was revealed that a bug hidden in Coinbase’s Ethereum smart contract setup could have given users access to unlimited amounts of ether. At press time, it does not appear as though the vulnerability was ever exploited or even noticed by users.The issue was first discovered last December by VI Company, a Dutch firm that specializes in fintech. The company was planning to give its employees ether bonuses in celebration of the upcoming holiday season when researchers noticed the issue with their “ETH receiving code” while garnering funds from a contract. They saw that by using a smart contract, a series of digital wallets could be “tricked” into recording ether transfers and purchases that had never actually happened.The team issued the following statement in a vulnerability report later published on the firm’s HackerOne account in January 2018:“By using a smart contract to distribute [ETH] over a set of wallets, you can manipulate the account balance of your Coinbase account. If [one] wallet transaction in the smart contract fails, all transactions before that will be reversed, but on Coinbase, these transactions will not be reversed, meaning a person could add as much Ethereum to their balance as they want.”The report specified the following steps for taking advantage of the exchange’s weakness:Set up a smart contract with a few valid Coinbase wallets and [one] final faulty wallet.Tr...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bug-caught-allowed-coinbase-users-garner-unlimited-amounts-ether/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/c80f03001M0.jpeg,Bitcoin|Technical,ETH|BTC|Trading

The purpose of this team will be twofold: promote the U.K.’s position as a leader in the emerging world of digital currency, while concurrently establishing the infrastructure needed to monitor the “potential risks” associated with the crypto space. This development follows a recent shift in the British government’s public attitude toward cryptocurrency. In January 2018, at the World Economic Forum, Prime Minister Theresa May voiced her apprehensions toward virtual currency and suggested that stronger regulations should be considered “very seriously” — a sentiment that was echoed earlier this month by BOE governor Mark Carney who, in an interview with CNBC, decried the “speculative mania” that surrounds crypto assets. His rhetoric, and that of the British government, has since changed. On March 18, preceding the G20 summit, Carney released an official letter through the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that dramatically reasserted his position. It stated that at its cu...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/uk-fintech-sector-strategy-announces-crypto-asset-task-force/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/eG4j350M0y8.jpeg,Bitcoin|Digital assets|Adoption,Regulation|BTC|Fiat

The big news in the days and weeks that followed, however, became that the government of Sierra Leone was denying that it happened.In a press release from Swiss-based blockchain technology company Agora on March 8, 2018, the company led off with this statement: “Sierra Leone’s 2018 presidential elections, which took place on March 7th, represents the first time in history that blockchain technology has been used in a national government election. West District’s results were registered on Agora’s unforgeable blockchain ledger, and the tally made publicly available days before the usual manual count.” The press release goes on to mention that the company is an internationally accredited observer and how results were posted within hours of the polls closing and various advantages to using their blockchain-based voting technology. Soon after, the story started breaking around the web that Agora, as the only company in the world with a fully-functional blockchain voting platform, had just run the first blockchain-based election for Sierra Leone. The results for this election are still unclear and a runoff election will be held on March 27, 2018; however, controversy over Agora’s claims erupted soon after the mainstream media began to pick up on the story.

The internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin.Dorsey’s optimism comes at a time when bitcoin and virtual money have been deemed “not that significant” by varying regulators. During Argentina’s recent G20 summit, several panel members stated their belief that it was not necessary to globally regulate cryptocurrencies just yet.They did, however, request that affiliate countries submit their recommendations for regulation by this coming July, so, while advocates of bitcoin may not see changes to the cryptocurrency infrastructure in the immediate future, that could change as early as this summer.Still, cryptocurrency was a large topic at this year’s summit, and many agreed that for now, things would remain as they are.Even longtime opponents like the Bank of England’s Mark Carney ultimately changed their sentiment.

The venture, announced in December 2017, pairs de Soto’s decades worth of reform experience as the founder of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy think tank with Patrick Byrne’s enthusiasm for bitcoin and the capabilities of its underlying blockchain technology.

This means that since December, the entire three-person board has been replaced.According to an announcement by the Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers, the former president of the Foundation, has stepped down and will be replaced by Ryan Jesperson, a Tezos project contributor. Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons also stepped down and will be replaced by Michel Mauny, a senior researcher at Inria, the French company that developed OCaml, the programming language Tezos is written in.  Another board member, Guido Schmitz-Krummacher, resigned in December “because he was frustrated with the infighting, which was consuming a lot of his time,” according to Reuters. He was replaced by Lars Haussmann, head of accounting firm Haussmann Treuhand AG, on January 31, 2018.

3132,2018-02-21,53640,1519252905,Korean Regulator Tips Cryptocurrency Prospects Back Toward “Normalization”,"  On February 20, 2018, investors saw signs of yet another directional shift in South Korea’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. According to Reuters, Choe Heung-sik, the governor of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), told reporters, “The whole world is now framing the outline (for cryptocurrency) and therefore (the government) should rather work more on normalization than increasing regulation.”The head of the FSS has wrestled with cryptocurrency regulation and the lack of legislation on the industry for some time. He stated in November 2017 that “supervision [of cryptocurrency exchanges] will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as legitimate currency.” Choe also warned of a bitcoin bubble in December 2017 that paired with another warning that month, when he stated, “All we can do is to warn people as we don’t see virtual currencies as actual types of currency, meaning that we cannot step up regulation for now.” The FSS, which has been spearheading the government’s regulation of cryptocurrency trading as part of a larger task force, has had an uphill battle in the face of Korean officials’ variable attitudes to the burgeoning industry. While the FSS-led taskforce set the nation’s first official rules around cryptocurrency trading on December 13, 2017, uncertainty around issues of taxation and regulation of the exchanges remained. January brought even less certainty to the peninsula as S...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/korean-regulator-tips-cryptocurrency-prospects-back-toward-normalization/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/e00400w0000.jpeg,Bitcoin|Regulation,Regulation|BTC|Trading|ICO|Business

Coinbase, on the other hand, tweeted that it had finished testing for SegWit for Bitcoin. It will phase in the launch, with the goal of “targeting a 100% launch to all customers by mid next week.” Coinbase affirmed its plan for a 2018 SegWit implementation on December 15, 2017 and seemingly delivered on the SegWit statements it made on February 13, 2018. Reasons for the support of using SegWit addresses are clear.  Prior to the activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork in August 2017, there were concerns about the scalability and malleability of Bitcoin due to the size limit of the blocks and a potential manipulation of the transaction ID.

3154,2018-02-19,53097,1519077864,Bitcoiner Faces Charges After Selling BTC to an Undercover Cop,"  On February 9, 2018, officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, arrested Morgan Rockcoons (aka “Morgan Rockwell” or “Metaballo”), CEO at Bitcoin, Inc. and an entrepreneur behind several other bitcoin startups, at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada.Rockcoons was charged with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, according to court records.According to those same records, in Southern California, between December 30, 2016 and January 8, 2017, Rockcoons allegedly exchanged around 10 bitcoin (worth around $9,200, at the time) for $14,500 in cash with an undercover law officer. That officer allegedly told Rockcoons in advance that the cash came from the manufacture and distribution of “hash oil,” which contains tetrahydrocannabinol, a controlled substance at the federal level. Money laundering happens when a person takes ill-gotten money and turns it into “clean” money that cannot easily be tracked back to its source. Thus, if Rockcoons knew the cash was dirty, but traded it for bitcoin anyway, that would constitute money laundering. Rockcoons was also allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business in Southern  California “from a date unknown” through August 30, 2017. Money transmitters are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The warrant for the arrest was issued b...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoiner-faces-charges-after-selling-btc-undercover-cop/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,Bitcoin|Law & justice,BTC|Business|Regulation

3183,2018-02-16,51840,1518819067,Decentralized Exchanges Stake Their Claim in the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem,"  The cryptocurrency ecosystem has continued to take some major hits lately, causing many investors and holders to rethink the way they trade their crypto assets. Several high profile cryptocurrency hacks have made the news in the past few years. In one of the most recent hacks, the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, Coincheck lost more than $500 million dollars worth of digital coins, adding to a growing perception that cryptocurrencies are particularly vulnerable to hackers.Yet, as the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies continues to increase (now above $4 billion), the most recent Coincheck hack may finally be a wake up call for crypto investors and holders. As the vulnerability of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming more and more apparent to the cryptocurrency community, some are looking to alternatives in the form of decentralized exchanges. Unlike a centralized exchange system that handles the trading of cryptocurrencies for its users, decentralized exchanges allow users to control their own funds within their own wallets. Decentralized exchanges do not rely on a third party service to hold a user’s funds, making them less vulnerable to large hacks. This also means that trades on a decentralized exchange happen directly between users in a peer-to-peer manner. These features make decentralized exchanges less vulnerable and much more transparent than centralized exchanges.Decentralized exchanges suc...",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/decentralized-exchanges-stake-their-claim-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoinmagazine/ag8w0h0M8wi.jpeg,Bitcoin|Privacy & security|Digital assets,Exchange|Business|BTC|Market|Trading

Neither the SEC suspension orders, nor any of the announcements by the companies surrounding the acquisitions, however, seem to actually focus on blockchain or cryptocurrencies. The assets that were acquired were trust units (shares) in a management company for a private equity fund that invests in at least 12 disparate sectors, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies.According to the orders of suspension by the SEC, the companies all set off alarm bells for the regulators when Victura Construction and PDX Partners issued press releases on January 4, 2018, related to the pending share acquisitions. Cherubim Interests issued a press release on January 3, 2018, to the same effect but was also cited by the SEC for its delinquency in filings with the SEC.
