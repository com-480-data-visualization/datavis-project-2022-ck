Additionally, titles like Apex Legends have found a strong player base with potential for long-term longevity. In the company&#8217;s latest earnings call this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson described blockchain technology, notably NFTs and play-to-earn capability as &#8220;the future of our industry.&#8221; The Future Of Gaming On the earnings call, Wilson added that &#8220;it&#8217;s still early to figure out how that&#8217;s going to work.&#8221; Given EA&#8217;s long-time licensing partners, most notably with heavy-hitting sports league IP, there&#8217;s clear-cut potential moving forward in integrating NFTs into gaming. How the ecosystem at large operates is a much muddier perspective. EA has long been criticized for it&#8217;s emphasis on loot boxes and pay-to-win incentives. However, in titles like FIFA (whose long-standing relationship with EA now seems to be in jeopardy), Ultimate Team player cards are already in a sense operating as centralized pseudo-NFTs. &#8220;In the context of the games we create and the live services that we offer, collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future,&#8221; Wilson added. &#8220;It&#8217;s still early to tell, but I think we&#8217;re in a really good position, and we should expect us to kind of think more ...",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ea-ceo-the-future-of-gaming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Cryptocurrency news|Axie Infinity|ea|Electronic Arts|gaming,Blockchain|Technology

980,2021-09-24,27089571,1632520027,Why Bitcoin Bears Might Not Get To Buy New Lows,"The crypto community is locked in debate over: Is Bitcoin in a bull or bear market? The debate will rage on until either a new high or new low is made. The current price action is bearish, which gives the impression that sellers are in charge. The news cycle, and sentiment doesn&#8217;t help the picture for bulls. But there is one &#8220;theory&#8221; that suggests a lower low won&#8217;t be made. Mapping Out From The Bear Market Bottom To The Bull Cycle Top Recently, Elliott Wave International held an Open House on their Crypto Pro Group led by analyst Tony Carrion. Tony nailed the recent 20% crypto market plunge as part of a C-wave and a short-term call. A longer term play looks ahead toward a positive Q4, where the analyst expects a wave five to develop and &#8220;greater price appreciation to occur.&#8221; If it fails to do so, then the pattern might not be valid. Related Reading &#124; Build Base Or Bust? Bitcoin Touches Down On Parabolic Support The recent accurate call of a C-wave prompted a deeper analysis of the longer term play. According to Elliott Wave Theory a primary motive wave consists of five waves, with odd-numbered impulse waves following the primary trend. This is Bitcoin we&#8217;re talking about, so the primary trend has almost always been up. A new motive wave and series of impulse waves began at a bear market bottom.

Additionally, reports state that the platform is looking at applying for an exemption to offer securities to non-accredited investors. Nexo is a London-based platform, which may play out to be a substantial advantage versus competitors that are stateside.

It is Decentralized Storage in which all the files are distributed into smaller fragments over the global network, comprising smaller network branches. Similarly, when a user requests a file, all the tiny pieces are assembled from different networks and then securely made available for the user. Storj is one of the older blockchain projects, founded in 2014, initially envisioned as an encoded crypto storage platform, later transformed into the network model.

1117,2021-09-11,27077565,1631394311,"Serum price analysis: SRM unable to break resistance at $13.6, a retracement to follow?"," TL;DR Breakdown The Serum price analysis for today is bearish.The SRM/USDT price currently rests at $12.5.The resistance is at $13.6, which remains unbroken.Major support is present at $10.2. The Serum price analysis for today is certainly bearish as the coin is currently seeing heavy pressure from bears. The bulls have been in charge of the price action as the cryptocurrency surged from $7.2 to $13.7 from 8th September to 11th September. This huge surge in the price of the coin attracted a lot of investors who were impressed by the brilliant performance of the coin. From the data provided by Coinmarketcap, it can be seen that the currency is trading with an increase in the trading volume by a whopping 74.65 percent. The market capitalization has also surged by around 24.25 percent. These metrics are very important because it can be seen that the surge in trading volumes and market cap means that the cryptocurrency is experiencing bullish growth for now. Considering the movement of Bitcoin today, the king of cryptocurrencies has dropped below the support at $46K but bounced off from the support at $44.7K, which still holds. This shows that Bitcoin might reclaim the support at $46K, as we can see a few green candles in the 4-hour chart.

Marlin (POND) is one of the hottest coins trading on Binance today as the cryptocurrency broke above the resistance at $0.07 and $0.11 as well. The price of the coin surged from $0.06 to $0.168 from 8th September to 11th September. Therefore, it can be said that the coin will break above the resistance at $0.16 in the long term. In the short term, the coin was unable to break this major resistance. According to the data presented by&nbsp;Coinmarketcap, Marlin&#8217;s price has been trading with a surge in the trading volume by over 115.42 percent. We can also see that the market cap has also risen by over 1.07 percent. While the cryptocurrency has been trading with a bearish outlook today, a detailed Marlin price analysis can be done using technical indicators. Now considering Bitcoin&#8217;s key movement today, it can be seen that the coin was unable to break the resistance at $47K and lost the support at $46K. It can be considered that the price of the coin will go down if Bitcoin is unable to reclaim the support at $46K and drops below the current support of $44.7K.

RiperDeFi aims to combat this. The ecosystem is an AgriDeFi (Agricultural Decentralised Finance) project built on an essential economy with pre-existing users. Its mission is to empower farmers and end their dependencies on debt by promoting an inclusive and decentralized platform for all.&nbsp; Background RiperDeFi&#8217;s CEO, James Yau, has been an active member of the farming community for over a decade. As a result of being directly involved in the industry, James noticed numerous points of concern in the agricultural sector.&nbsp; Firstly, large buyers can secure lower prices by making big orders; in return, banks and governments incentivize them with more favorable terms, grants and subsidies. Thus, farmers often find themselves giving up large amounts of crops for very little in return. There is also no access to micro-financing in times of economic difficulty. In the event that their customers fail to pay or become bankrupt, farmers would lose out on their payments completely with no options for recourse.&nbsp; RiperDeFi’s Vision RiperDeFi&#8217;s mission is to provide decentralized financial services solutions that are efficient, sustainable, and inclusive for everyone, helping farmers reach financ...",https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13A-9j_sVDpsE20dX84dnP8Y,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png,,Market

Fantom has performed exceptionally well when compared to other cryptocurrencies. It has been trading with a bullish outlook jumping from $0.4 on 27th August to the current price of $1.2. This huge surge in price brought the attention of major investors and traders, resulting in a new all-time high for the coin. The trading volume for the currency is currently down by 27.71 percent. The price movement was unable to break the resistance at the $1.11 price level yesterday, although today, it was broken, and the current price of the FTM/USDT pair is at $1.2. According to our Fantom price analysis, the FTM/USDT pair can make a move for another resistance at $1.314. If the price action doesn&#8217;t fall at this point and the resistance remains broken, higher prices are possible after a cool-off period. Bitcoin price analysis for today reveals that the cryptocurrency broke a minor resistance at $50K and has found support at that price level.

After reaching out towards the lower support at $44,000, the pair started moving up towards the $46,300 level after being rejected from there later in the afternoon. Profit-taking is the reason why bulls are unable to penetrate beyond $48,000 in a decisive move with massive volumes.

The daily chart shows a high of $47,500, and the bulls have fallen drastically near this level. The 200-day moving average is beckoning the price to cross $45,000, but the 21-week moving average is putting pressure from above. The potential bullish signs are evident in the rise from $44,000 to the current $44,900 as per Bitcoin price analysis.
