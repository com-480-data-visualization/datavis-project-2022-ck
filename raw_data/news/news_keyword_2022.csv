6,6,2022-03-24,27482337,1648155609,How to Read the Crypto Chart?,"Trading cryptocurrencies and turning your Bitcoins into money requires the ability to read crypto charts. For making good crypto trades you need to know Dow Theory and Japanese candlestick charts. Every historical price, volume, and time interval is available in cryptography. A chart is used to observe investment opportunities in a digital currency based on its past price movements. By reading cryptocurrency charts, investors can identify market trends and predict the future price movements of an asset. Cryptocurrency Chart Patterns Only a few chart patterns have stood the test of time. There is no “proven” chart pattern that works better than another, unlike less subjective analytical tools. Following are the chart patterns available. Price Channels Create a series of highs and lows by creating two ascending or descending parallel lines. Prices tend to bounce between these levels of support (lower) and resistance (higher). While most traders buy lower and sell higher, breakouts and breakdowns can be influential. Ascending & Descending Triangle One horizontal line connects highs or lows, and a second sloped line connects rising highs or falling lows. In a right triangle, the price tends to break out or break down from the horizontal line in the direction of the sloped line. Head & Shoulders The Head and Shoulders chart pattern is characterized by a temporary high or low, followed by a big move higher or lower, followed by an e...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/how-to-read-the-crypto-chart/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Live Crypto News|News|Candlestick Chart|Chat patterns|Crypto market charts|Cryptocurrency Chart Patterns|fundamental tenets|Technical Analysis,Trading|Market|Business

The token could break above $0.27 and rally to February 2022 highs. Past Performance The GALA price remains in consolidation inside a bull flag considering gains over the past few months. GALA has been stable in the past 24 hours but is up 11 percent in the previous trading week. Overall, bulls are in a commanding position, sustaining prices inside the broader ascending wedge with clear support at $0.21 marked by March 16 lows. GALA Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is northwards based on the recent price performance. Technically, GALA prices are consolidating, trading inside a narrow $0.07 trade range with caps at $0.27 and $0.20 on the upper and lower ends. There has been confirmation of the bullish engulfing bar of March 16, suggesting strength. Aggressive traders can load the dip inside the March 16 trade range above $0.20 with targets at $0.27 and later $0.38—marking February 2022 highs. What to Expect Blockchain gaming and NFTs are finding widespread adoption—a fundamental factor supporting GALA bulls in the long haul. The immediate resistance level is at $0.27. However, if prices crash below $0.20, the token may drop towards 2022 lows of $0.17.The post GALA Prices inside a Bull Flag, Surges 11% as Buyers Target $0.38 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/gala-prices-inside-a-bull-flag-surges-11-as-buyers-target-0-38/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Blockchain Crypto News|Breaking News|Live Crypto News|News|Technical Analysis|GALA|GALA bulls|GALA price analysis|GALA prices|GALA technical analysis,Trading|Market|ICO|USDT|Blockchain

While many believe Bitcoin will become the world’s reserve currency, others predict privacy coins like Zcash will take over. But there may be another contender who could be one of the biggest blockchain technology breakthroughs. That is Algorand, an innovative platform based on proof-of-stake algorithm and security deposits. A Review of Smart Contracts What is a smart contract, really? It is a computer program that controls financial assets or property and executes exactly as programmed. It’s to digitally facilitate, verify or enforce negotiation or performance of an agreement. So, there is no need for a third party (like a bank). Essentially, the intention is to replace trust in humans with trust in code. But what does that actually mean for you and me in practice? How will smart contracts change everything for blockchain technology? How do we decide which ones are best for our own needs—whatever they may be? Let’s take a closer look at some potential use cases of blockchains when it comes to smart contracts. ​ One of the most useful applications of smart contracts in decentralized file storage. For example, suppose someone wants to store data on IPFS but can only commit small amounts of money at a time due to constraints set by their employer or university.

75,75,2022-03-17,27468274,1647550850,Anchor Protocol: DeFi’s Leading Saving Product,"In the past few years, DeFi applications have seen tremendous growth. At the start of the year 2021, the Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications was used to be around 18 billion dollars. Currently, TVL in DeFi applications is around 200 billion dollars, which is more than 10x of the TVL of January 2021. Total unique DeFi wallets are 4.3 million right now, more than 4x the unique DeFi wallets of January 2021. Various DeFi applications provide financial services like lending & borrowing, trading, prediction markets, yield farming, etc. Still, there are only a few million DeFi users, and the Anchor protocol of Terra Ecosystem wants to change it. Team of Anchor Protocol believes that a saving product is required for the mass adoption of DeFi applications. Anchor is a saving protocol that offers low-volatile yields on deposits of Terra Stablecoins. The Anchor interest rate is powered by staking rewards from Proof of Stake blockchains, and therefore more stable rates can be expected.

The burning of $1 in UST results in the minting of $1 in LUNA and vice versa. The purpose behind the recent move is to maintain the stability of UST and its peg to the U.S. dollar. While other stablecoins manage to maintain this peg using various systems, UST relies on its relationship with LUNA, and the arbitrage opportunities that the treasury offers to traders.

It is a blockchain-agonistic protocol that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports smart contracts, such as Ethereum, NEO, QTUM, or EOS. However, it is worth noting that they are more than just an exchange app. They are a protocol that promotes interoperability among decentralized applications (DAPPs) with exchange functionality by acting as a common building block for open standards. Trades are carried out using an Ethereum smart contract system that is open to the public, free to use, and to which any DApp can connect. What Is Loopring (LRC)? Loopring (LRC) is an open-source and audited non-custodial exchange protocol. It aims to enable anyone to build decentralized exchanges on top of it by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs ensure that assets remain under the control of users at all times. Loopring’s goal is to improve order execution efficiency and DEX liquidity by centralizing order management and settling trades on the blockchain. The vast majority of cryptocurrency trading takes place on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges operated by private corporations. The three main risks of centralized exchanges are a lack of security, a lack of transparency, and a lack of liquidity.

A close above $14.5 may accelerate the recovery, pushing prices towards $20 in the medium term. Past Performance It has been a challenging three months for Chainlink bulls as per the LINKUSDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. At spot rates, LINK has reversed all gains posted in H2 2021, shrinking 65 percent from 2021 peaks. Although bears appear to be in control, Chainlink has been flat-lining at around $12, tethering at near 2022 lows. Chainlink Technical Analysis After deep retracements, sellers are still in control, pinning Chainlink prices at 2022 lows. The immediate support is at $12. While LINKUSDT consolidates horizontally, there must be a sharp close above the middle BB—the 20-day moving average—and $14.5, confirming gains of March 9 for possible bullish resumption. A close above $14.5 may trigger demand, lifting LINK towards $16 and later $19 as LINKUSDT bottoms up above critical liquidation levels. On the flip side, losses below $12 may see LINK plunge to new 2022 lows, continuing the intense selling pressure from mid-November 2021. What to Expect of LINK? Fundamentally, Chainlink plays a critical role in DeFi and blockchain gaming. However, after a strong performance from early 2020, the retracement in the crypto market didn’t spare Chainlink. $12 marks a vital level.

Historically, investors see gold as a reliable safe-haven asset they can run to when stocks and bonds decline. It is not surprising for gold prices to have seen a 19-month high as the U.S. and UK decided to ban Russian energy products. It seems that now investors are not only attracted to the metal, but to gold-backed tokens as well. What Crypto Can Expect From Macro Uncertainty The macro uncertainty has only increased in 2022, starting with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, then escalating as the sanctions on Moscow have a direct effect on commodities prices. Moreover, analysts expect that a rising U.S. inflation will be reflected in the CPI numbers to be published next Thursday. Arcane Research data noted that CPI is expected to reach 7.9%, and the Federal Reserve might perform the 25 basis point rate hike that chair Jerome Powell said he is inclined to support. Bloomberg experts, however, project for &#8220;February CPI to show an increase of 8.0% year over year and top out in the vicinity of 9% in March or April,&#8221; and added that &#8220;CPI could rise above 10%&#8221; if energy prices continue to rise. The Fed has also said that they might move more aggressively later on if inflation does not come down.

The current geopolitical situation generates uncertainty for both households and markets. The question of a million dollars for bitcoin seems to be whether it can still work as a hedge against inflation or has February proven the opposite. Geopolitics And Bitcoin A report by QCP Capital points out that, historically, the has been a poor correlation between BTC and Gold prices, which puts into question if the digital asset can be treated as a hedge against inflation to help protect the value of investments and individuals&#8217; savings. Sanctions against Russia will be felt by everyone around the world. Global oil and gas prices have already surged and are expected to escalate further.

Below are the predictions for 2022 addressing potential trends and forecasts that may materialize soon. Addressing Limitations of a Seamless Infrastructure Even if competition among infrastructure providers is expected to heat up dramatically in 2021, critical challenges must still be addressed. Ethereum (ETH), for instance, is still the most popular blockchain for DApp (decentralized applications) creation, although it suffers from network congestion and expensive transaction costs.

Addressing such limitations this year and beyond is required. Many individuals anticipate that the release of Ethereum 2.0 will assist to relieve some of these issues. Its sharding implementation will help solve issues such as network congestion, transaction fees, and low performance. These implementations may take time as they will occur in multiple stages.

In a tweet made minutes before the time of writing this article, the Bitcoin critic criticized mainstream media houses like CNBC for ignoring the 2% drop in Bitcoin’s price in the face of a crisis, when gold was up by 2% to $1863, which is its highest price in the last three months. He also said that had the situation been reversed, CNBC would be constantly talking about it. Many Other Than Peter Schiff Predict a Fall in Bitcoin Prices Over the Weekend Incidentally, Peter Schiff is not the only one speculating a drop in Bitcoin’s price. With the U.S. urging its citizens to leave Ukraine amid the threat of a war with Russia, many have been left wondering if this will lead to a fall in Bitcoin’s price. Schiff, in one of his tweets made a few days ago, had said that gold was a potential alternative to Bitcoin and it was a safe investment. The situation between the U.S and Russia has been deteriorating rapidly as there have been speculations about Russia planning to invade Ukraine over its growing inclination towards the European world. Experts predict that if there is indeed a war between these two giants, it would take a massive toll on Bitcoin’s prices. If that happens, the bull run for Bitcoin would be short-lived after it managed to crawl its way back to $45,000 after falling to $33,000 last month.

Bitcoin Vs. Crude Oil In a new Bloomberg Intelligence report, data shows trends that could favor Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The report noted that &#8220;Representing advancing technology, Bitcoin is gaining traction as a benchmark global digital asset, while oil is being replaced by decarbonization and electrification.&#8221; Lack of supply elasticity is an attribute shared by Bitcoin and Ethereum that &#8220;sets them apart from commodities&#8221;.

Thus, gaining the title of strong one, during November 2021-February 2022 fall, the QTUM cryptocurrency went into the category of doubtful. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZPrYnTT2/ Yes, the QTUM price successfully stopped at the important level of $5.2.

When big money started entering into the crypto space, bitcoin was the first stop before it diversified into other assets. However, as time as gone by and more altcoins are beginning to gain popularity, bitcoin is losing its hold as the number 1 choice for investors. A recent survey that featured respondents from the ultra-wealthy class showed that they did not favor bitcoin as their first choice. Rather, they picked an altcoin whose growth has rivaled and even surpassed that of bitcoin since its inception. Ethereum Comes On Top Crypto.com revealed that the wealthy are gradually moving away from bitcoin. Their obvious choice besides the leading cryptocurrency is ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The numbers provided by the crypto exchange showed that ethereum has made its mark on the wealthy. With its broad range of use cases and applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, the value of the cryptocurrency has shot up exponentially. And with that has come more confidence from investors.

Bitcoin has lost 50% of its value since November. This isn’t unusual for a cryptocurrency; it went through a similar slump from April to July 2021, and then immediately recovered. From a statistical standpoint, Bitcoin appears to be a high-volatility asset with no clear medium- or long-term trending or reverting patterns. It’s not a completely random walk in which the future path is unaffected by previous price fluctuations, but it’s closer than most major assets. Bitcoin Lacks ‘Economic Anchor’ Due to its volatile nature and the market-wide correction in crypto, there has been a lot of criticism going around regarding digital assets (especially Bitcoin), all over the internet. The recent one came from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of “Black Swan”, who sent out a tweet that went viral. He said: “For a contagion-driven asset with no economic anchor such as #BTC, a falling price does not make it ‘cheaper’ and more attractive. A falling price makes it less desirable [and], paradoxically, more [expensive]. Why? Because the price is its only information.” This is not the case experimentally over the brief history of Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin when the price was falling was just as appealing as buying it when the price was climbing in the past. Taleb, on the other hand, presented an economic claim rather than a statistical one. So it doesn’t matter if BTC holds the ...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/bitcoin-lacks-economic-anchor-but-you-should-not-worry-heres-why/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Cryptopedia|Latest News on Bitcoin|Live Crypto News|News|Opinion Piece|Top Picks|Bitcoin|Bitcoin bear|Bitcoin Bulls|Bitcoin News|crypto|Crypto News,BTC|Trading|Market

The Fed&#8217;s move, although hawkish, wasn&#8217;t a complete surprise. As the Fed promises to modulate interest rates in order to achieve its goals of raising employment and getting price stability, investors responded with fear. Bond yields are climbing above pre-pandemic levels, thus affecting the traditional and crypto markets. Investors fear the Fed&#8217;s focus on getting inflation under control because the markets&#8217; reaction is not a priority amongst the entity&#8217;s task. If the Fed moves on to more hawkish reports, markets are likely to keep reacting in a downward motion. How Hawkish Is The Fed? The central bank had already reported that “With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.” Now, the Fed announced interest rates will remain unchanged. However, a quarter-point rate hike is expected to happen in March, which would be the first rate hike since 2018. Afterward, they will start shrinking the balance sheet, which has swelled to nearly $9 trillion in response to bond holdings.

620,620,2022-01-21,27426673,1642800640,Overview of Third Generation Crypto – Cardano,"Cardano is one of the most widely used types of cryptocurrency, a type of digital currency that can only be used online. Cardano was founded in 2015 and first traded publicly in October 2017 for a few pennies per token. The currency is now worth more than $1.20 in January 2022, after having peaked at more than $3 in the previous 52 weeks. It is one of the top ten most valuable cryptocurrencies in total value. Cardano was established by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, another renowned cryptocurrency, and it uses blockchain technology to run on a decentralized public ledger. Like an unending receipt, Blockchain administers and monitors the cryptocurrency, documenting, and arranging every transaction that occurs with it. This decentralized mechanism validates transactions, checks their integrity, and aids in the system’s overall stability and error-free operation. In addition, Cardano has a “proof-of-stake” method, in which currency owners are entrusted with verifying transactions in exchange for a reward. This “staking” incentive might be a fun way to get money. What Is the Origin of Third Generation Crypto Cardano Coins? According to CoinMarketCap, there were approximately 33.5 billion ADA in circulation as of January 2022. Therefore, the entire supply of coins is limited to 45 billion. Cardano is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a fixed quantity of 21 million units. And it’s in contrast to Ethereum, which has an ...",https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/overview-of-third-generation-crypto-cardano/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png,Altcoin News|Breaking News|Cardano News|cryptocurrency guide|Cryptopedia|Live Crypto News|News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Cryptocurrency|proof of stake|Smart Contracts|Third Generation Crypto,ADA|ETH|Blockchain|BTC|Mining

Of course, bitcoin (BTC-USD -7.2%), which is seen as a proxy for MSTR stock, is falling well below its $40K key level to five-month lows. Specifically, the SEC objects MicroStrategy (MSTR) from using non-GAAP principles to show what its income would have been if it didn't have an impairment charge, Bloomberg notes. Note that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is classified as an intangible asset under GAAP principles, meaning companies that don't qualify as investment firms record digital assets at historical cost and only adjust it if its value declines, Bloomberg cites the SEC's letters. Once impaired, companies cannot revise the value back up if the price recovers.

The country&#8217;s Central Bank suggested that the trading of cryptocurrencies must come to a stop immediately. In the report put forth in an online press conference, the Russian government along with the Bank of Russia suggested this regulatory measure.

Take into account that Fidelity is a multinational financial services corporation, it doesn’t get more mainstream than this. I agree with @Fidelity, of course, but still astonishing to read this on Bitcoin adoption game theory in such a mainstream financial report: pic.twitter.com/7zRO9rEele &#8212; Alex Gladstein 🌋 ⚡ (@gladstein) January 13, 2022 What did Fidelity say about Bitcoin adoption at the nation-states and central bank level? They put it very clearly: “We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future.” In other words, It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.
